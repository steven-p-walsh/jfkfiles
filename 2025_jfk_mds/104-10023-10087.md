CHAPTER III
15 November 1974

ANNEX B
THE 201 SYSTEM

Resolution: Annex B of Chapter III, CI/IS 79-1-1, 27 October 1966.

1. INTRODUCTION

The 201 system provides a method for identifying a person of specific interest to the Central Intelligence Agency and recording and indexing all pertinent information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying other persons who have contact with the subject and for producing lists of 201 personalities according to those categories. Only a relatively small number of personalities listed are of sufficient interest to justify assigning a 201 identity. These are usually subjects of extensive coverage by CIA investigation, prospective agents or sources, members of extremist groups and individuals occupying key positions, or subjects on whom a volume of correspondence has accumulated.

2. THE 201 SYSTEM

The principal features of the 201 system are:

a. The 201 Number, a unique number, (e.g., 201-123456), assigned to each individual in the system to serve as identifying file number for reporting on that individual.

b. The 201 Dossier, the official file containing the 201 opening form (Form 61) and biographical data, source reports, reference copy of credentials, [?per-?] sonal history, correspondence, and photographs.

c. The Master 201 Record, a cross index record created by the Main Inventory Section, which indicates all dossiers which may later be retrieved for specific things.

d. Match Index Master 201 Reference file section, prepared jointly by the various components of the Agency, containing information on individuals known to each component and indicating the component’s interest in that individual.

e. The Cumulative 201 File, a compilation of all 201 numbers assigned as of a [?specific?] date.

**SECRET**

**DCI/IA**
**CHAPTER III, ANNEX B**
**15 November 1974**

a. OI Code: a two-letter symbol used in conjunction with the 201 personality records to identify an individual’s association with organizations or with organizational activities of intelligence interest. OI codes cover [state]sponsored and non-state sponsored activities, whether such agent, or front or suspect, as well as activities of DDO interest. There are two categories of OI codes for use by components:

(1) General OI codes (Attachment 4)
(2) OI codes assigned to a specific component for intelligence services or other supportive organizations.

A component may request an OI code be established by submitting a memorandum to the DDO/IMO through the Component Records Management Officer.

A 201 personality may be assigned two OI codes. An OI code may be assigned when the 201 Personality File Action Request (See paragraph 2b below) by filling in Box 13 or a code may be assigned or added at a later date by a DDO officer. 

The 201 system has the capability of producing machine listings of 201 personalities by OI codes. For example, an OI code has been created for the known activities of a certain country; a listing may be compiled of all members of that service.

b. 201 Machine Lists produced from the mechanized 201 Index, based on name or other identifying information of personalities on whom 201 dossiers exist.

**3. OPENING A 201 DOSSIER**

a. General:

The opening of a 201 dossier is the prerogative of an operational component. The establishment of a dossier indicates that the component has a master 201 record. Changes to the master record and 201 dossiers will be reported as outlined in paragraph 3d below. Dossiers are opened on a 201 subject who is controlled jointly by more than one component, or when there is a need for consolidated reporting. The opening of a dossier does not necessarily mean that the subject’s identity has been positively established; however, it indicates that sufficient information concerning a person about whom counterintelligence information is being reported, and/or to provide a central point for the collection of data on an individual or group whose activities are related to intelligence, subversive, or other sensitive operations. The dossier will be opened by the component which has primary responsibility for the subject’s coverage.

persons who are only of local interest to a field station or Headquarters desk and on whom no DDO records correspondence exists are not a part of the DDO records system and are to be maintained by that unit. Some desks may require assists on ISG for automatic DOI openings on certain categories of persons whose names appear in incoming dispatches. These are listed in Attachment 2, DOI dossiers should be opened in the following categories:

(1) Subjects of provisional operational approval and operational approval requests. However, a file should not be opened with a POA is requested for persons being trained for a foreign liaison service and who are of operational interest for training purposes only.

(2) [illegible: approximately 3 words] for whom the field requests a DOI opening.

(3) [illegible: appears to be a name] personalities; bonafide diplomats of other than denied area countries, in close association with staff personnel.

(4) Subjects of a Personal Record Questionnaire Part I.

(5) Persons on whom a Main Index search reveals information in five or more documents (see DDI 70-20).

(6) Subjects of Interagency Source Register memoranda from LSN/I.
ISG (opened only by [illegible: appears to be an agency acronym]).

**3. Requesting a 201 File Opening.**

Headquarters deals may open 201 file by filling out and submitting a 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 52) to the Records Male, Headquarters (D/IRMS). Form 52 is to be completed with as much information as possible. If any of the requested information is not known at the time of submission, indicate “unknown.” A copy of Form 52 and all supporting documentation may accompany the 201 personality file request. However, the requestor is responsible for ensuring that Headquarters receives both the form and the supporting documentation. The D/IRMS will acknowledge receipt of Form 52 within five working days. If the requested information is not sufficient to open a 201 file, the D/IRMS will return the Form 52 to the requestor with an explanation as to why additional information is needed. A request to open a Spanish DOI filing on the through-the-fence operation must be coordinated with the Chief, Western Hemisphere Division, prior to submission of Form 52.

**a. Purging**

Purging a 201 dossier is the responsibility of the desk officer. It requires discretion in recognizing, especially with personal material, rather than the strict application of rules. This action should be taken only when it takes place under the supervision of a [Records] Officer. Purging should be done periodically and a report submitted to Central Files as instructions are issued. A 201 dossier should be purged if any of the following:

(1) Duplicate dossiers, (i.e., exact copy) of a document.

(2) Name trace forms (Form 39B) unless it has been the basis for the opening.

(3) All abstract slips.

(4) Document retention notices (Form 1864).

(7) Memory copy documents which only repeat substantive information contained in the original documents in the file; submission for destruction by the Records Officer.

(8) Top Secret documents are not to be retained in a 201 dossier forwarded to Central Files, the document must be downgraded for retention in the 201 dossier. To downgrade a Top Secret document, an authorization is required from the originating agency or the Records Copy. Having obtained such authority, a copy of the downgraded copy and the covering approval will be attached to the original document when it is forwarded to Central Files, along with a memorandum to the [?] Control Officer, the location of which is shown in paragraph 7a(9). The 201 file giving the justification of the TS downgrade.

(9) Deferred Form 689s (See 9b(5)).

**b. Maintenance Procedures**

(f) “Shadow” and duplicate (shadow) 201 files, no longer of active interest should be incorporated into the official 201 after the duplicate material has been purged by the desk officer and the remaining information classified to that [?]HQ/Analysis? (D/AN).

(g) Any documents from a predecessor organization never cover at an OPC (Office of Policy Coordination) cover sheet from the Archive and Reference Section (IP/ARD) must be returned to IP/ARD for processing to the 201.

(h) Desk memoranda (with or without a document source number) concerning substantive or derogatory information on the subject of the 201 should go to [?]D/AN? to be classified officially from that desk officer. 

(i) To assist the analyst in determining the correct 201, the basic documents in a 201 dossier may be categorized as follows:

(1) Japan (JN), NYBAT, or KAFOK with a blue tape (see DOD DIR 501.1) indicating the country of primary interest;
(2) Japan (JN), NYBAT, or KAFOK with a red tape indicating secondary interest;

Based on one or more of the following selection criteria:

(1) Country of location
(2) Ol code (occupation and/or intelligence affiliation)
(3) Citizenship 
(4) Year of birth (plus or minus a given number of years)
(5) Occupation. 

These selection criteria may be used singly or in combination. For example, a search might be conducted for all individuals with Ol code AA, or with Ol code of XX or codes of XX, XY, or XZ. A 201 personality that could also be produced of all persons who were born in Germany between the years 1935 and 1945, with the exception of those who became citizens of the United States, located in Marion, and who have assigned Ol code AA. These searches may include a combination of any number of codes. Ol code AA. Those personalities with an Ol code other than AA and those with no Ol code would be excluded. The requester could however ask that persons who have not been assigned an Ol code also be included. Since also given, the listing will be only for persons. The personality is specified by name or [?number?] in the search request. These searches cover more than one survey only a documented counter. Some occupation codes cover more than one occupation. For example, the occupation code CRAP covers both radio and television operators. If a list is requested for personalities, including only those coded with electrical skills, the personality would be listed under that category only. The search criteria may include key words (average) according to location. 

(1) Surname
(2) Given name
(3) Date of birth
(4) Country of birth
(5) Citizenship
(6) Ol code

**PERSONALITIES - 201 AND IDN NUMBERS**

1. A relatively small proportion of the total number of personalities indexed by the CS are of active operational interest at any given point in time. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, [?gold?] numbers of groups and organizations of continuing target interest. Each of these personalities is assigned either a 201 number or an IDN number.

2. The 201 number serves a dual purpose. It brings the files on these personalities into the CS records system. A single number, e.g., 201-13456, is assigned to each person, and a dossier controlled by this number is established which contains all cross reference to it, all of the reporting on the individual’s personal history, current status and prospects. Once the 201 number is assigned, it is used in future reporting on the individual both as a file number and in place of other identifying data. Up-to-date machine listings are published periodically to help field stations and headquarters desks keep book on those 201 personalities falling in their particular geographic or functional area of interest.

3. It has become usual that the 201 machine listings should include only those of personnel of operational interest because of their connection with a target group or organization even though there may not be sufficient information or specific interest to warrant opening a file. For example: A considerable number of stations are concerned with the activities of Cuban exiles. Because of their movements, functions and objectives can be assisted by furnishing all participating stations up-to-date listings containing information under the control

4. To accommodate this type of requirement in the 201 system, identifiable personalities concerning whom enough information is not yet available to require the opening of a file may be assigned numbers of the following type:

IDN-12345

These are related "201" if a file is opened. IDN numbers are carried with 201 numbers in appropriate general or special listings, where they are identified by the letter “I” in the “Type of Name” column. IDN numbers are not US file numbers.

5. All 201 code numbers are assigned by RID at headquarters, either upon receipt of Form 831, or of a field dispatch. If a dispatch is written about a personality not yet in the system, a 201 number for it may be requested simply by writing under headquarters file number in the dispatch form as follows:

Dispatch Symbol and No.
XYZA-12345
Headquarters File No.
201-_______

6. IDN numbers are assigned by RID at headquarters upon the request of stations or desks which are developing special identification programs within the 201 system. The field receives current notification of new 201 openings and IDN numbers through the Field Index Card.
