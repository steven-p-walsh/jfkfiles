## MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

### SUBJECT: Backstopping of Cover by the Research Institute of America

1. Pursuant to conversations between Mr. Rose and Mr. Engel of CIA/Op and Mr. Travis of OO/Contacts, an appointment was made for Mr. Rose to see Mr. Leo Cherne, Executive Secretary of the Research Institute of America, 292 Madison Avenue, New York City, to explore the willingness of Mr. Cherne to backstop the cover story of a proposed agent in training. The appointment was made, and kept, for Wednesday morning, 23 January 1952 in New York City in the presence of Mr. Clark of the New York branch of the Contacts Division.

2. The proposed story of the [agent] in question, who had been employed on the economic research side of ECA specializing in Italy, was that he wished to resign from ECA and take up an offer to be extended to him in civilian employment. Since the Research Institute of America seemed to fit in naturally with his background and activities in ECA, Mr. Cherne was asked:

   a. If he would backstop the [agent] story that he was quitting ECA to take employment with the Research Institute of America during his three months period of [training] with CIA; and

   b. Whether he would in fact employ the [agent] and send him as a representative of the Institute to [Italy] at the conclusion of his period of training.

Mr. Cherne replied that unfortunately the latter was impossible inasmuch as his company did not send personnel overseas in any capacity. As regards the immediate backstopping of the [agent]'s story, however, Mr. Cherne said that he would be happy to oblige for a period of training only, to wit, three months, after which other cover would have to be sought. Mr. Cherne requested that he be furnished at an early date in the role as a backstop and further stated that he would like to meet the [agent] personally as soon as could be arranged. This has been communicated to Mr. Engel, the case officer, who will oblige at the earliest opportunity.

When Mr. Rose of OPC was in New York on 23 January 1952 to discuss cover with Mr. Leo Cherne, Executive Secy. of the Research Institute of America, Mr. Cherne requested additional information as to what was to be expected of him in his role as a backstop to the cover being established for the OPC man.

Chief, Cover Division, PLANS/OSO  
19 May 1952  

Appointment with William A. BARRON, John E. TOULMIN, and Leo CHERNE  

Reference: CS-2512 and CS-1337  

1. This will confirm Mr. Rose's verbal request that the Contact Division/00 exit the Boston field office to arrange appointments for Mr. Edward Rose of Cover Division, PLANS/OSO, to see Mr. William A. Barron, Chairman of the Board, Gillett Safety Razor Company, and Mr. John E. Toulmin, Senior Vice President of the First National Bank of Boston, at their convenience on Wednesday May 21, 1952. The purpose of the visit is to explore the willingness of these gentlemen to act as ostensible donors of funds to support a current operation.  

2. This will also confirm Mr. Rose's request that the New York City field office of the Contact Division/00 arrange an appointment for Mr. Rose to see Mr. Leo Cherne, President of the Research Institute of America at Mr. Cherne's convenience on Thursday May 22, 1952. Mr. Cherne, who has for some time been basking the activities of an agent in this country, has apparently expressed willingness to provide cover for the agent abroad. The purpose of the interview is to discuss more fully Mr. Cherne's proposal. Cover Division would be happy to have an 00 field office representative present to ensure continuity.  

3. As a result of the above requests, Mr. Barron found to his regret that he was unable to cooperate with the Agency at the present time. Mr. Toulmin, on the other hand, was most cooperative. Mr. Cherne, unfortunately, was out of town. The New York field office has been asked to try to arrange a meeting with Mr. Cherne, as outlined above, for Wednesday afternoon, June 4, 1952.

**TO:** Chief, Contact Division, OO  
**FROM:** Chief, Cover Division, PLANS/OSO  
**SUBJECT:** Field Trip to Interview Leo Cherne  
**Reference:** CS-1357  

1. On Wednesday, June 4, 1952, an interview was arranged by the Contact Division, OO, for Mr. Rose of the Cover Division, PLANS/OSO with Mr. Leo Cherne, President of the Research Institute of America. The meeting was held at 1130 a.m. in Mr. Cherne’s office at 292 Madison Avenue, New York City, and Mr. Rose was accompanied by Mr. Clark of the New York field office of Contact Division, OO.

2. Mr. Cherne, who is currently [backstopping an operation?] within the United States, had expressed the wish to be provided with some form of letter indicating that the Agency was requesting his cooperation, and the purpose of the interview was to inform Mr. Cherne that this was against Agency policy.

3. This information was accordingly conveyed by Mr. Clark and Mr. Rose to Mr. Cherne who accepted it with good grace. In reply to a question by Mr. Rose, he indicated that this refusal would in no way mitigate his desire to be of service to the Agency.

**MEMO FROM SUPPORT (TRAVIS) N/A 8598**  

**CASE 9145**: RAY MILHARD HAS REQUESTED THAT YOU PASS SOME INFORMATION ON TO LEO CHERNE. AS YOU KNOW, AS DOES CHERNE, THAT WEIGHT OUR MAN WHO IS DOING WORK FOR LEO, HAS ALSO BEEN WRITING FOR **THE NEW LEADER**, AS WELL AS WORK DOING OTHER JOBS. IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT THE EDITOR OF THE **NEW LEADER**'S **LEVITAS** IS GOING TO TAKE A TRIP TO THE AREA WHERE OUR BOY IS LOCATED, AND WILL SEE HIM. WHEN OUR BOY SEES **LEVITAS**, HE IS GOING TO TELL HIM THAT HE DOES SOME WORK FOR LEO CHERNE, AND OTHERS, BESIDES SUBMITTING ARTICLES FOR **THE NEW LEADER**. HE WILL NOT OF COURSE, IDENTIFY HIMSELF WITH THE AGENCY. **LEVITAS** IS UNWRITING OF ANY AGENCY RELATIONSHIP, AND IT IS DESIRED THAT HE KEEP THIS WAY. ON THE OFF CHANCE THAT CHERNE MAY SEE **LEVITAS** AND OF THE FURTHER CHANCE THAT UPON HIS RETURN TO THE US, **LEVITAS** MAY SEE CHERNE AND TELL HIM THAT HE RAN INTO OUR BOY, WHO INDICATED THAT HE WAS DOING SOME WORK FOR CHERNE, WILL YOU TELL CHERNE THAT **LEVITAS** IS NOT WRITING OF THE FACT THAT THE NEW BOY IS CONNECTED WITH THE AGENCY AND THAT HE SHOULD NOT INDICATE TO **LEVITAS** ANYTHING OR ASSUME THAT **LEVITAS** KNOWS OF THE AGENCY RELATIONSHIP. THANKS VERY MUCH.

## Security Information

**Office Memorandum**

**TO:** Chief, Contact Division, OO  
**FROM:** Chief, Cover Division, PLANS/OSO  
**SUBJECT:** Appointments with William A. Baron  
**REFERENCE:** CS-1516 and CS-1357

---

### Case 413

1. This will confirm Mr. [Roes?] verbal request that Contact Division/OO assist its Boston field office to arrange appointments for Mr. Edward [Roes?] of Cover Division, PLAN 08 to see Mr. William A. Baron, Chairman of the Board, Gillette (Safety Razor Company), and Mr. John [Toulm?] Senior Vice President at the [First National Bank of Boston?], at their conference on Wednesday May 21, 1962. The purpose of the visit is to explore the willingness of these gentlemen to act as potential donors of funds to support a current operation.  
   
2. This will also confirm Mr. [Roes?] request that the New York City field office of the Contact Division/OO arrange an appointment for Mr. [Roes?] to see Mr. Leo [Chene?], President of the Research Institutes of America at Mr. [Chene's?] convenience on Thursday May 22, 1952. Mr. [Chene?], who has for some time been backstopping the activities of an agent in this country, has apparently expressed willingness to provide cover for this agent abroad. The purpose of the interview is to discuss more fully Mr. [Chene's?] proposal. Cover Division would be happy to have an OO field office representative to assist in this meeting.  
   
3. As a result of the above request, Mr. [Chere?] found it sad to note that we were unable to cooperate with the agency at this present time. Mr. [Toulm?] on the other hand, was most cooperative. Mr. [Chere?], unfortunately was out of town. The New York field office has been asked to try to arrange a meeting with Mr. [Chene?], as outlined above, this Wednesday afternoon, June 4, 1952.
