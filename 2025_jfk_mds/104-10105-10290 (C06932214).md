2 November 1973

MEMORANDUM FOR: Acting General Counsel  
SUBJECT: Mr. E. Howard Hunt - Alias Birth Certificate  

1. On 30 October 1973 I saw Mr. John S. Warner, Acting General Counsel, to discuss two outstanding requests from the Special Prosecutor's office in regard to U.S. passports which had been issued to E. Howard Hunt and a MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD on Mr. Robert Bennett's session with the U.S. Prosecutor Silbert in July 1972. I handed Mr. Warner a memorandum listing the type, number and dates of the 2 passports which Mr. Hunt was issued between 1950 and 1970. In reviewing the information in this memorandum, I mentioned Mr. Hunt's tour in Spain in the middle 1960's and the fact that I had been instructed not to include Mr. Hunt and his activities in my inspection of the Madrid Station in 1965. I also mentioned to Mr. Warner that I remembered two discussions with Mr. Skip Dunn late in 1972 during which he inquired of me whether CIA had ever issued an alias passport to Mr. Hunt. I said that as I recalled, CIA did not initiate the issuance of a U.S. alias passport, but that Mr. Hunt did have in his possession an alias travel document. This came as a surprise to Mr. Warner. He had not been previously aware that Mr. Hunt possessed a U.S. international travel document in alias. As a result he called Mr. John Richards, Office of the IG, and asked whether Mr. Richards was aware of this and whether Mr. Dunn's reports provided this information. After an interval, Mr. Richards called back and told Mr. Warner that I had provided information to Mr. Dunn that Mr. Hunt had a tourist card in alias. According to Mr. Richards, Mr. Dunn's memorandum quoted me as saying that my information came from an "A -1 source." At that moment, I could not recall having made such a statement.

## 2. 
Upon my return from Mr. Warner's office, I consulted with Mr. James W. Franklin, Chief, Official Cover Branch, CCS, with whom I had discussed Mr. Dunn's inquiry in late 1972. I asked Mr. Franklin whether he could refresh my memory. This he did immediately. He reminded me that a newspaper article (Tab A) had appeared claiming that one of the Watergate 5 had carried a U.S. passport in the name of Edward Hamilton. This newspaper article had been seen by Mr. Robert Johnson, Deputy Director of the U.S. Passport Office, who had had the U.S. Passport Office files examined with negative results. Mr. Johnson then determined from the FBI that the document involved was not a U.S. passport in the name of Edward Hamilton but a tourist card in that name. I then remembered that because the information came from the FBI via Mr. Johnson, I had not identified the source of my information. I immediately called Mr. Warner and advised him of the foregoing.

## 3. 
Later in the afternoon of 30 October 1973 Mr. Franklin came to my office with a number of documents. They consisted of a form memorandum signed by me which was addressed to Mr. Hunt dated 29 June 1970 (Tab B), a list of names numbering from 1 through 54, representing true names (Tab C), and a second listing similarly numbered, representing aliases (Tab D). Number 63 on the true name list reads E. Howard Hunt and on the alias list, Edward Joseph Hamilton. Mr. Franklin explained -- which I had forgotten -- that we had obtained from TSD this list of outstanding alias birth certificates issued by TSD in an attempt to recall -- if possible -- as many of these documents, or to determine what had happened to them. (Most of these alias birth certificates were issued in connection with the Bay of Pigs Operation.) The memorandum was never forwarded to Mr. Hunt because by June 1970, he had been retired for 3 months. This memorandum had not been included in Mr. Hunt's cover file but had been kept with the working papers pertaining to the action trying to recall as many of the outstanding alias birth certificates as possible. As a result, the repeated reviews of Mr. Hunt's cover file had not yielded the information that an alias birth certificate had been issued to him. 97 of the 154 aliases were not previously recorded in the CCS central index and the indexing after the acquisition of the list had been overlooked. The surfacing of these documents at this time occurred because in re-discussing Mr. Hunt's possession of an international travel document in alias reminded Mr. Franklin of the 1970 CCS exercise of recouping outstanding alias birth certificates. Discussions on the same subject in December 1972 simply did not result in the same memory association.

4. In the late afternoon of 30 October 1973 Mr. Franklin and I saw Mr. Warner, reported the foregoing facts to him, showed him the documents, and agreed that we would ask Mr. Johnson to check the Passport Office files once more to confirm that no U.S. passport in the name of Edward Joseph Hamilton had ever been issued to Mr. Hunt. The result of Mr. Johnson's check is still outstanding at the time of this writing.
