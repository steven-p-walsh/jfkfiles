# SUBJECT: Court Foster Wood

[Michael Weimer Stratton] has recently advised that Court Foster Wood was a relatively close high school friend of [Stratton] during mutual attendance at George Mason High School, Falls Church, Virginia, during 1957 to 1959. [Stratton] described Wood as an average high school student who had no particular problems with the exception that there were domestic difficulties between the father and mother of Wood.

[Stratton] became acquainted with the parents of Wood and made occasional visits to their home during the above period of time. The father of Wood, Foster Wood, is an attorney who was then living in Falls Church. Some time ago the father and mother of Court Wood split up and Court Wood and father moved into an apartment on Columbia Road, Washington, D.C.

[Stratton] advised that after graduation from high school in June 1959 he lost any close contact with Wood, who then started to attend George Mason College, where he seemed to have an interest in philosophy. [Stratton] started to attend a military school and Wood expressed extreme opposition to military schools.

[Stratton] married in 1960, which also helped to move [Stratton] away from Wood. [Stratton] believed he see Wood but advised that after this period in which he did not see Wood he had had a number of contacts with Wood, many of which occurred during mutual attendance at the University of Virginia Extension School (night school) in early 1961. On one occasion [Stratton] attended a party at the apartment occupied by Wood and father at the invitation of Wood, and on this occasion came into contact with the "new set of friends" of Court Wood, whom [Stratton] described as being "beatnik types." Girls in attendance at the party, according to [Stratton], appeared to be of the "street pickup" type.

After the above party Wood occasionally telephoned [Stratton] and about Christmas 1960 Wood called and stated that he was going to Cuba under the auspices of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. [Stratton] called on Wood after the return of Wood from Cuba and at that time Wood lauded Castro very highly. The father of Wood was also in sympathy with Castro. [Stratton] recalled that he again, at a later date, had visited the Wood apartment, this being an occasion when Wood had been visiting somewhere in Falls Church and contacted [Stratton] to ask [Stratton] to take Wood home.
