## Section D
### Narrative Description

Award for Heroic Action or Acceptance of Hazard: Was act voluntary? Describe what was outstanding, and if it was more than expected. Explain, why, and how. If an aerial or marine operation, describe type and position of craft, crew position of individuals, and all unusual circumstances. Indicate results of the act.

Award for Achievement, Service, or Performance: State character of service during period for which recommended. (Give complete description of individual's occupation, training, assignments, and responsibilities if not covered in Section C; include details for assignment and relief.) What did the individual do that merits the award? Why was this outstanding when compared to others of like grade and experience in similar positions or circumstances? If appropriate, include production records, assistance rendered by persons or units. What obstacles were encountered or overcome? Indicate results of achievement, service, or performance. Include references to Fitness Reports, Letters of Commendation, or other documentation already on file which supports this recommendation. 

> From early December 1965 through May 1966, Messrs. James W. McCord, Jr., Alan F. Petit, and William M. Marcy, of the Technical Division, Office of Security, spent many off-duty hours in experimentation with various items of equipment in an effort to improve and strengthen the Agency’s Audio-Visual Resources Program. They conceived and developed a unique tech[?tech?] in fluoroscopic scanning which is considered to be a major breakthrough in the detection of clandestine microphones and other devices targeted against the Agency. It gives the Agency the first time the capability to[?to?] get hidden technical listening devices, a capability for which the intelligence community has expended large sums of money to develop in a number of approaches. This tech[nology?] will not only benefit the security of all Agency installations at home and abroad, but will be of utmost benefit to other agencies in the community. This technique was met with wide acclaim by the Intelligence community and the Technical Security Committees.

In experimenting with the [X-ray?] in combination with a fluoroscopic screen, these men showed this combination had distinct advantages in terms of time and effort over the considerably more expensive [X-ray? film and processor?]. In further refinement of this technique, they designed an innovation in the form of [fluoroscopic cloth?] which has the distinct advantage of flexibility over the [fluorescent screens?] currently available on the commercial market.

## Section D Continued - James W. McCord, Jr.

To further enhance the use of this equipment, these men developed an inconspicuous, easily transportable package, consisting of two attaché cases which hold the (X-ray fluoro-24) [uncertain: ?] scope equipment, wall racks, and motor units. This makes it possible for an audio-countermeasures team to enter offices, residences, and safehouses without undue attention.

These men have shown great ingenuity and resourcefulness in the application and development of this audio-countermeasure technique. Through their further efforts in package design, they contributed significantly to the future clandestine use of this technique on a world-wide basis. This technique provides the Agency for the first time a procedure through which large interior wall surfaces, room furnishings, and objects can be rapidly scanned in "real time" in the search for hostile technical penetrations. This capability will significantly enhance the security of all Agency installations.
