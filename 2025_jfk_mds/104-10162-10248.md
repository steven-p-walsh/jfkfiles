**Date:** 20 January 1967 
**From:** Deputy Chief, WDC  
**To:** Chief, Foreign Division, JFG  
**Subject:** Chief of Station, Madrid  

## Action: FFI

It is late December 1966 and early January 1967 that [CENTRAL] described AVOCOL in detail regarding its medical colleges still in Cuba. AVOCOL has at least part of its field would like to leave Cuba. A majority of these described below are psychiatrists who are either away or separated by the effect of the Castro regime. Almost all of the psychiatrists mentioned have relatives and assets among Cuban Government officials; in AVOCOL's opinion, these defects would exacerbate in extreme certainties of their considerable knowledge.

The absence of psychiatrists would be especially harmful to the present Cuban Government; this is fed with a rapid increase of suicides, mental illness, and alcoholism, stemming from a general breakdown of mental health as traditional values are reported and replaced by repugnant, unwholesome demands.

> In the descriptions that follow, it should be noted that the Department of Psychiatry of the University of Kansas Medical School is composed mostly of about 200 psychiatrists from the psychiatric staff of several hospitals, where the chances actually are given there is no University Hospital.

  **Vazquez, Alfonso**.  *Instructor - Department of Psychiatry, University of Puerto Rico*. Has been an instructor since April, 1941; graduated from the University of Puerto Rico, but not fully trained in medical therapy. He is a scholar recognized by his peers and has taught courses in September 1936. In this case, I would recommend him as a candidate. It is virtually certain that I will not select him as a candidate. Terms would be an exercise - chance of recruiting for use of access.

He is currently attempting to obtain a scholarship to study abroad in order to better serve his patients, especially children. Writes a scathing critical of the Pedro and Vivas, who reportedly made millions of dollars in construction and real estate before Castro came to power. Before they could resume their lives abroad, he gave Miguel a favorite trip upon graduating from medical school. Miguel is also from a wealthy family. Age 33, 5'6", 160 pounds, brown hair. Once outside Cuba with his family, they would defect and possibly could reestablish an access route.

### 129
#### SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY: A STUDY ON ITS LIMITS AND BASIC CONCEPTS
By Dr. Leopoldo R. Llanio/Jornal

(1) Professor of Medical Psychology, School of Medical Sciences of the University of Havana. Director of the Department of Social Psychology of the Institute of Advanced Nervous Activity.

#### ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC ALTERATIONS IN THE TRANSPULMONARY VASCULAR COMMUNICATION
By Dr. A. Fernandes Carvajo(*), Dr. M. José Kon(**) and Dr. J. Cassio Harrow(**)

(1) Professor of Internal Medicine, Head of the Cardiology Department of the Convalescent Manuel Pardo Training Hospital.

(**) Assistant Specialists, Department of Cardiology of the Convalescent Manuel Pardo Training Hospital.

---

### 142
#### CONCLUSIONS
1. The electrocardiograms corresponding to 33 cases of mitral stenosis operated transventricularly were studied.

2. The variations, as well as the favorable changes in the atrial and ventricular complexes, are those which, according to other authors, are present in patients operated transauricularly.

# Document Title

## SECTION I

1. **Incidence of Polycystic Injury**  
   Various incidents of polycystic injury were observed incidentally at our examination. This injury is similar to that observed in patients with the suicide.

2. We were able to observe a fast dilation of the QRS axis towards the left, accompanied by signs of left ventricular hypertrophy, which shows severe mitral insufficiency.

3. The possibility of myocardial infarction following the trans-  
   **ventricular mitral dilation** is mentioned.

## CORDIC OBSERVATIVE PHENOMENON(*)  
   PSYCHOANALYSIS

By Dr. Alberto Orlandini N.(**)

(*) Presented before the First Regional Congress on Stomatology of Southern Oriente, on 29 October 1964.  
(♦) Resident of the Psychiatric Service, Provincial Training Hospital of Santiago de Cuba.

---

## SUMMARY

A chronic obstructive emphysema with breathing difficulty originates first drowsiness, and then catatonic stupor. The psychic disturbances following the changes of consciousness are described.

---

## CARDIOVASCULAR ASPECTS OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE(*)

By Dr. Jose Cabera Flores(**) and Dr. Hugo Cernas Gallegos(***)

(*) Presented before the First Regional Congress on Stomatology of Southern Oriente, Santiago de Cuba, October 1964.  
(**) Dr. Enrique Cabrera Cosio, Cardiovascular Department, Provincial Hospital of Santiago de Cuba.

---

## CONCLUSIONS

After studying eight patients with Sickle Cell Disease, the most important observation has been the enlargement of the electric systole shown by the electrocardiograms. This is to be confirmed in subsequent studies. Other observations are the presence of the EKG changes in the two cases presenting the lowest hemoglobin level, the evolution with normal cardiac output in most cases. This phenomenon is present in the evolution of chronic anemic syndromes and has not been fully explained yet.
