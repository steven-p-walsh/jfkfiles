![Description of what the image shows](image)
Description: The image shows a transmittal slip with several fields filled in. The slip is largely blank, with "TO:" appearing to be followed by illegible text. The slip also features the headings for FROM, ROOM NO., BUILDING, and EXTENSION but lacks specific data. "REMARKS" section is empty. There appears to be handwritten text at the bottom which reads "Pe"!d" and "7 m" (uncertain content). The overall design appears official or administrative in nature.

**Memorandum**

**TO:** Director, Domestic Contact Service  
**Attn.:** Operations Support Staff  
**FROM:** Chief, New Orleans Office  
**DATE:** 28 December 1966  
**SUBJECT:** Possible Opportunity to Recruit Agent in Place in Cuba  

1. On Tuesday, 20 Dec 66, I received a call from Mr. Frank [?Barrtes?], former President of the Consolidated Railroads of Cuba. He is an alien but has FBI approval to contact dated July 61. Mr. [?Barrtes?] is the source of live reports on Cuba and us, as well as the FBI, have been in frequent contact with him.

2. He called me primarily to tell me that his mother had arrived from Cuba and would be willing to talk to me.

3. In the course of our conversation Mr. [?Barrtes?] told me that he had a cousin still living in Cuba named Alicia Crèe Bastillo, who is a ballet dancer associated with Alicia Alonso, the prima ballerina of Cuba and also a well-known Communist. [Mr. ?Barrtes?] says that Alicia Bastillo is not a Communist and he and his family have been in contact with her.

4. Ms. Alicia Bastillo, who is about 29 years of age, was one of the girls of the Cuban ballet dancing with the group in Paris, and this received wide publicity in our newspapers. Alicia Bastillo, however, did not dance with the group, as confirmed on the tour and returned to Cuba with the group. According to Mr. [?Barrtes?], Alicia has recently injured her foot and is not meeting with Cuban refugees.

5. Mr. [?Barrtes?] says that Alicia Bastillo has traveled all over the world with the Cuban ballet group and has met most of the Communists including Castro. He is fairly certain that the Cuban group will undertake another tour and that he will be advised in advance of the date and destination. He feels quite certain that he will be able to establish something if Alicia Bastillo provided the group visits a non-Cuban country. He believes that he has always been very close to what Bastillo's intentions are concerning the approach. He feels quite certain that she would be willing to help him if she were approached in the proper manner, and not feel that an approach should be made through him because of his relationship with former Cubans close to her.

6. He says that he believes Ms. Bastillo does not attempt to

28 Jun 66  

I know Cuba because of the fact that her family is there and that she would not leave unless she could also get her family out. He believes that, despite the risk involved, she would be willing to act as an agent in place.

## 8: My relations with Mr. Bartos have been very good, and I am inclined to believe what he says. However, this would need to be evaluated by the clandestine services, of course.

> 9: There is one other matter I would like to mention in connection with a group of Cuban exiles in the Cayo, as being a potential candidate. He did not tell me and I did not ask what the separator of this group was or Mr. Saunders. He did, however, mention Colonel Weber and a connection, and it is the clandestine services will already have a good deal of information about Mr. Bartos.

Further information which I can provide, I shall be glad to do so.

Rene Garcia cleared him for solo 31 Dec and told subj fly in pattern making landings, [??] flew to River House where he buzzed friends and then engaged in dog fight with Navarro, made only one landing; does not retain training even though repeated time and again.

B. Navarro: First flight Leo 16 Dec, last flight 3 Jan. Sick three times, once from drinking too much, grounded once for drinking before a flight; does not check VOR or compass (in first flight compass off 90 degrees and did not notice); will not do 60 degree turn because "I don't like 60 degree turns"; same as Bartes on simple maneuvers in air, touch and go landings told repeatedly use 41 inches but still uses 42-43 inches; speed brakes down one entire flight. Power settings and mixtures consistently cleared by A3 for landings, instead buzzed River House and got into dog fight with Bartes. When aircraft returned, checked meter and found minus three registered. Subj soaking wet indicating he had been in some trouble.

**REPORT NO.:** OO- B. 3/11/53  
**DATE DISTR.:** [date unknown]  
**NO. PAGES:** 1  
**REFERENCES:** [references unknown]  

**DATE OF INFO.:** Late May 1960  
**PLACE & DATE ACC.:** Late May 1960  

> **SOURCE:**  
> U.S. citizen, a pathologist who has recently returned from Cuba where he spent five years in charge of rice production and associated research on a large rice plantation at Jaboa near the Company/Farmers' board.  
>
> 1. Just prior to my departure from Cuba on 25 May '60 I talked with a Vice President at one of Cuba's larger mills. He casually spoke of inspections tours of the railroad's facilities, and had just returned from an inspection of the company's spar lines in the Sierra Maestra region of Oriente province. He was accompanied at this time by a Cuban Army.  
> 
> 2. One of the spar lines in the Sierra Maestra ran into a restricted area. In this area my friend observed various construction efforts near large concrete slabs, immediately adjacent to which were several sources of rock. This area is known as being quite mountainous with very thick foliage in most places. From his very limited knowledge of the subject, he stated that he has seen the same kinds and amounts of rocks in adjoining areas, and said that these rocks seemed to harbor interesting formations. He expressed concern that a good idea to ask many questions was regarding these rocks further.  
>
> 3. My observations of large concrete tanks "an enormous open tank specifically cited in this box may accept the first 48 hour weather watch in Galley. It is not clear whether the reasons for maintaining a huge tank over larger tanks can come from the air."  
> 
> 4. I have noted that the tenth floor of the Brooklyn building reserved for the  
> Special Branch while carrying these years’ special reflections might serve as an analysis that the questions never appeared on that floor. I inquired of a cashier clerk from Liberty Center, and they stated that while those charges rarely remain open to red flags, it was my observation that on the Sixth Floor, this 4-sided complex, instead served as access. It was not clear to me why Liberty was resorted to in equal pairs of records that leaked and was not lined as this laundry is marked by room, where these facilities remain absent.

Dear Mr. Modell,  

Mr. Bartes was examined by me on 20 November 1965 for routine Federal Aviation Agency Class II physical examination which he successfully completed and was issued a medical certificate. He has a glasses limitation due to distant and near vision deficiency.  

He was given the following vaccines: Cholera, Typhoid, Typhus, para-typh., small pox, Diph. Tete.  

Mr. Bartes is to return as a later date for his Chest X-ray and H/8.  

Thank you for referring this matter.

# UNITED ST. .AS GOVERNMENT 
## MEMORANDUM

### TO:     Director, Domestic Contact Service  
### ATT.:   Operations Support Staff  
### FROM:   Chief, New Orleans Office  
### DATE:   28 December 1966  
### SUBJECT: Possible Opportunity to Recruit Agent In Place In Cuba  

1. On Tuesday, 20 Dec 66, I received a call from Mr. Frank Bartes, former President of the Consolidated Railroads of Cuba. He is a pencil in the to have first approval to contact dated 24 for FBI. Mr. Bartes is the source of five reports on Cuba and us, as well as the FBI, have been in frequent contact with him.

2. He called me on primarily to tell me that his mother had arrived from Cuba and would be willing to talk to me.

3. In the course of our conversation, Mr. Bartes told me that he had a cousin still living in Cuba named Alicia Cruz Bustillo, who is a ballet dancer associated with Alicia Alonso, the prima ballerina of Cuba and also a well-known Communist. Bartes says that Alicia Bustillo is not a Communist and he and his family has been in contact with her.

4. Miss Bustillo, who is about 29 years of age, was one of the group of Cuban ballet dancers which recently made a tour of Europe. A group of these Cubans detected with the group was Paris, and this received wide publicity in our newspapers. Miss Bustillo, however, did not defect and returned to Cuba with the group. According to Bartes, Alicia Bustillo has recently injured her foot and is not dancing, but is working as secretary to Alicia Alonso.

5. Mr. Bartes says that Miss Bustillo has traveled all over the world with the Cuban ballet group and has visited most of the countries including Chile. He feels quite certain that the Cuban group will defect this year and that he will not be able to proceed in advance of the fact of history. He feels quite certain that he will be able to arrange a meeting with Miss Bustillo and provide the group visited a non-communist country, as related to him. He feels quite certain that she would be willing to help in the effort to arrange the meeting in the proper order. And he feels that the approaches will be made through him because of his relationship and former connections to her.

6. He hopes that he believes Miss Bustillo does not attempt to

14. I believe Cuba because of the fact that her family is there and that she would not leave unless she could also get her family out, he believes that, despite the risk involved, she would be willing to act as an agent in place.

8. My relations with Mr. Bartos have been very good, and I am inclined to believe what he says; however, this whole matter, of course, would have to be evaluated by the Clandestine Services.  

9. There is one other matter I would like to mention: In connection with Mr. Bartos and that is that he served for two and a half months with a group of Cuban fillers in the U.S. as he holds a lot's license. He did not tell me and I did not ask who the sponsors of his group were or what their duties were. He did, however, mention a Colonel Weber and operation and, if so, the Clandestine Services will already have good deal of information about Mr. Bartos.

10. I pass this on for whatever it is worth, and, if there is any further information which I can provide, I shall be glad to do so.

## IN 26440  Page 364

Bit fully documented from: 50 notes taken while riding in back seat.

3. Rene Garcia, acting chief pilot, told PO's that in his opinion neither man has had more than 259 flight hours each. Garcia, who prong play up permit pilots as being better than they are, said both need minimum 54 additional flight hours.

4. Marynoti and Macicoe have made every effort possible to train these men adequately in minimum time, consistent with safe operation of aircraft. The allowance made for language problem and fact it's new to subs, PO's believe  FOUL is minimum required, in addition to what already given, to have subs marginally acceptable; total 55 more flight hours broken down as follows - 8 transitions; 25 formation and gunnery; 18 navigation; 12 instruments.

5. On basis above Ricanda believes Bartes definitely not worth additional hours required to train him to marginal proficiency. Thus intend to return him to Conus unless Hqs disapproves. Navarro is at best marginal case also. Weighted against giving Navarro additional 50 hours (which will require minimum 4-9 weeks) is transition training to be given three.

**14 April, 1965**

## TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

This is to certify that I have known Mr. Francisco A. Bartos since June, 1962. He contacted our company to obtain a license permitting him to continue flying in the United States after his departure from Cuba.

Mr. Bartos held a Cuban pilot license issued by the Civil Aeronautics Commission of Cuba, November 22, 1956, No. 1017, multi-engine Aircraft VFR.

The total aircraft flying time has been estimated due to the fact all personal effects including his log books were lost in Cuba. A certification from Sunny South Aircraft, Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, substantiates his estimated time due to single and multi-engine aircraft:
 
| Aircraft  | Total Hours |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Cessna 172| 130:00      |
| Cessna 182| 250:00      |
| Cessna 310| 750:00      |

Mr. Fausto A. Valdes, a Cuban citizen now residing at 10 SW 32nd Ave., Miami, Florida, holding an ATR certificate, 1515842, issued 11/28/61, has also certified via affidavit. Mr. Bartos has close to 1,000:00 hours of multi-engine time.

Mr. Bartos has completed the Private Pilot course with us and has the necessary papers pertinent to an FAA license. He is presently continuing his studies for a Commercial Pilot rating - single and multi-engine.
