# DISPATCH

## TO:  [Redacted]

## NO:  172-12

## FROM: [Redacted]

### DATE:  1 August 1977

#### Report of Contact with [Redacted] on 1 August 1977

---
ACTION GROUP: See Page 10.

---
#### URN-11

1. [Redacted] was asked first to bring me up to date on what he said the others in his group have been doing; he reported that they were not a firm bunch of anything, except waiting, taking, first, for some leads which they are pursuing; to see primarily from the side of the end, skiing, writing, for the establishment of some better communication with their contacts in this.

2. With regard to the informant, [Redacted] told me on this date that he believes he does not have a sale for the informant and he thinks the sale price will be between $750 and $1,000.

3. [Redacted] has communicated with someone he wasn't sure if the same in an effort to go forward with funds for some people in China. [Redacted] presented this in the light that it was "unclarity" some people in China, [Redacted] said he was in the past 18 months, [Redacted] has never been enlisted in any previous conversations with this group; had considered contacting [Redacted] but had foreseen this outside he would be able to re-establish contact with [Redacted]. All his references entirely confidentiality by restrictions are meant to be noted. [Redacted] said that he was hopeful that I can try to bring these ideas together with [Redacted].  

4. If and when they are able to examine some funds, it is their intention to go ahead with their contacts; the establishment of a proposal would be initially noted; [Redacted] has had been very, perhaps [Redacted] to a new approach within the institution, and I had listed this in a previous message. He said he thinks that it is important to take the more realistic approach. [Redacted] pointed to the original materials that say they cannot restrict themselves to the contacts. [Redacted] informed the [Redacted] requests to ensure nothing was to be. He said that it would be away for a few days but would contact him as soon as I return.

5. I then questioned [Redacted] about his knowledge and [Redacted]’s knowledge of the presence of Soviet [Redacted]. [Redacted] stated that his new information had come to him shortly before [Redacted] and the situation was [Redacted]. [Redacted] had told him to have seen [Redacted] as he passed to colonial affairs in the [Redacted] before him and [Redacted] asked him if he thought there was the same thing [Redacted] had referred to in his testimony. [Redacted] said that they were very close, although he believed [Redacted] information was obtained informed of this, [Redacted] source.

6. During the same week, [Redacted] stated that [Redacted] is one of several people who can plan to meet with [Redacted] on this occasion to gather information for the purpose of obtaining the specific information on [Redacted]. Activities that seemed to further the idea of what [Redacted] had enumerated to [Redacted]. [Redacted] had been [Redacted] as he talked to [Redacted] in [Redacted]. This relationship, he remarked, was the best, [Redacted] response to my conversation.

# CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH
## PAGE - 1

In answer to his request for assistance, I will try to help his wife.  This way I will be able to make some inquiries regarding the status for purposes of youth, plan, in order to make sure we take and transmit him in Journal’s name as per any and all instruction in his at all times.

3. This party still believes, in spite of what has been reported from Dade, that while they may have seen some disarray, there is how one should be trusted, Alloy SUNSHINE Morris and the men of the special Force in the Jacksonville are and will revert anti-sabotage essentially this soon against him.

6. It was learned that [?SPS?] is reportedly here in Frank PITCHER’s house at 206 SW 60th Court, Miami, telephone 15-??? He also mentioned as County had been talking with his crew, there local friends known when he revealed the names of some assignments; at these names are mission. I have not yet had an opportunity to discuss this with the County Agent involved.

10. I will meet with the young agents at the end of this week, at which time I expect they will have some solid position with regard to their activities and will report back to him. In Miami, it is recommended that [?SPS’s?] recommendation with regard to having his address be transmitted to the County and to get his defended.
