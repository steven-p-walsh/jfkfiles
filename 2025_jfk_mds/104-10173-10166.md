## MEMORANDUM FOR: Director  
Federal Bureau of Investigation  

### SUBJECT: Dr. Martin Luther KING, Jr.  

1. Reference is made to this Agency's out-message number 94270 dated 25 April 1968 concerning the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther KING, Jr.  

   On 16 April Roderick Claftin BROWN, a Panamanian national born 1 July 1917 in British Honduras, voluntarily appeared at the Department of National Investigations (DNI) of the Republic of Panama and signed a deposition, the highlights of which are as follows:  

   (1) On 26 October 1962 he served as cook/saaman aboard the Tonnaco 3 S. Southabaton which docked at Mobile, Alabama.  

   (2) While on a shore visit to the Mobile airport on the morning of 26 October 1962 in the company of two fellow Panamanian seamen, he was approached by Marvin P. LITTRILL, owner of LITTRILL Motor Co.; 921-25 South Clinton Street, Athens, Alabama, who after ascertaining BROWN was a Panamanian seaman, asked if he knew of Dr. Martin Luther KING, Jr.  

   (3) LITTRILL inquired whether BROWN was interested in employment; the details of which were unspecified. He went on to describe Dr. KING as "our greatest problem" who is causing us much trouble. He gave BROWN a business card to use in the event he was interested in pursuing the employment offer.  

   (4) On 28 January 1963 BROWN wrote LITTRILL from New York City, stating he was interested in a job and

### Content

requested $75 for travel from New York City to Mobile.  
On 2 February 1963 BROWN received a reply from LITTRELL,  
stating that he had a job waiting for BROWN in Alabama,  
but questioning why $75 was needed since the fare was less  
than $40 by bus.

(3) After discussions with relatives and friends  
in New York City, BROWN suspected that the LITTRELL job  
offer was related with assassination plans for Dr. KING.  
Therefore, he did not respond to the LITTRELL letter and  
dismissing the incident until the death of Dr. KING in  
April 1968. BROWN returned to Panama in 1968.

Enclosed for your information is a copy of the  
LITTRELL letter and the Spanish language deposition made  
by BROWN, as well as an English translation of the deposition  
as described in paragraph 2 of the referenced out message.

AMERICAN NEGRO IS NOT WILLING TO CONTEMPLATE IMPASSIBLY THE ASSASSINATION OF OUR LEADERS, OUR HEROES, AND OUR PEOPLE.

EM GRAMMA, 0 APRIL, PAGE 3 A ARTICLE BY JUAN HARRED ENTITLED "THE AMERICAN NEGROES ARE WRITING THEIR FINEST PAGE OF HEROISM." JAAGAINST ALL THAT AND MUCH MORE, THE NEGROES ROSE UP TODAY IN MORE THAN SIXTY CITIES. AND IT IS LOGICAL TO EXPECT NEW PAGES OF HEROISM. STOKELY CARMICHAEL, THE NEGRO LEADER, GAVE THIS WARNING ONE DAY AFTER THE DEATH OF MARTIN LUTHER KING: "WHAT HAPPENED ON THE NIGHT WE LEARNED OF THE ASSASSINATION OF DR. KING IS NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN."

R.H. GRAMMA, 0 APRIL, PAGE 3 A JTH WIDOW OF LUTHER KING, HEADS THE MARCH IN MEMPHIS. THE ARTICLE TELLS ABOUT THE MARCH AND SHOWS PHOTOGRAPHS OF IT.

UM RADIO REBELDE NEWCAST, 1 APRIL, 7:55 A.M./A. A JJA TENSE CALM REIGNS IN THE U.S., BUT IT IS A PRELUDE TO SERIOUS EVENTS. NATIONAL MOURNING DECREED BY LYNDON JOHNSON FOR YESTERDAY, 4 APRIL MARKS A LESSENING OF DEMONSTRATIONS WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO START UP AGAIN AT ANY MOMENT.

UM RADIO LIBERACION, 1 APRIL, 12:39 P.M./A THIS NEWSCAST REFERS TO A DEMONSTRATION IN WHICH 200 LATIN AMERICAN, ASIAN, AND AFRICAN STUDENTS WERE SAID TO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN FRONT OF THE U.S. EMBASSY IN WARSAW, POLAND, AS A PROTEST OVER THE DEATH OF MARTIN LUTHER KING.

AND THAT THESE FLAMES ARE RISING VIOLENTLY TO PUT AN END TO ALL THE OPPRESSION AND INJUSTICE WHICH IS FOUND IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH HINDERS THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.

> **RADIO LIBERACION, 5 APRIL, REP P.M.** - STOKELY CARMICHAEL, LEADER OF BLACK POWER, SAID - "WE NEGROES MUST ARM OURSELVES WITH RIFLES AND PISTOLS AND LAUNCH AN ASSAULT ON THE STREETS OF THE CITIES OF THE UNITED STATES IN REPRISAL FOR KING'S ASSASSINATION." CARMICHAEL PREDICTED THAT THERE WILL BE EXECUTIONS IN THE STREETS AS A RESULT OF KING'S ASSASSINATION. HE ALSO PREDICTED THAT THE VIOLENCE WHICH HAS BEEN UNLEASHED BY NEGROES AS A RESULT OF KING'S DEATH WILL BE PALE AS COMPARED TO WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN AMERICAN CITIES.

> **RADIO HABANA, 7 APRIL, 2 P.M.** - "KING'S DEATH SHOWS ONCE AGAIN THAT THE EXPLOITED MASSES CAN ONLY ANSWER REACTIONARY VIOLENCE WITH REVOLUTIONARY VIOLENCE."

> **RADIO PROGRESO, 5 APRIL, 10 P.M.** - CARMICHAEL SAID DURING A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW THAT A SERIOUS MISTAKE HAS BEEN MADE IN ASSASSINATING DR. KING BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN THE LEADER OF A MOVEMENT WHICH URGED THE NEGRO PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES NOT TO BURN THE CITIES, NOT TO COMMIT ACTS OF VIOLENCE. THIS MEANS THAT IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO START AN ALL-OUT REVOLUTION. CARMICHAEL ADDED - "SERIOUS INCIDENTS HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN 35 CITIES WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN FIRES, SHOOTING, FIGHTING, AND DEATHS AS A RESULT OF THE CRIME COMMITTED AGAINST DR. KING. NATURALLY, OTHER SIMILAR THINGS WILL TAKE PLACE. GUERRILLA WARFARE WILL RAPIDLY SPREAD THROUGH THE CITIES BECAUSE IT IS ALREADY EVIDENT THAT WE CANNOT OPENLY REBEL AGAINST THE POLICE." STOKELY CARMICHAEL ENDED THE INTERVIEW BY SENDING AFFECTIONATE REGARDS TO THE REVOLUTIONARY CUBAN PEOPLE AND THEIR LEADER, FIDEL CASTRO RUZ.

WILL RISE FROM THEIR GRAVES AND FORM AN INVINCIBLE ARMY.

* *RADIO LIBERATION, 7 APRIL, 7 P.M.* - *EDITORIAL COMMENTS*

CRITICIZING THE NON-VIOLENT LINE WHICH WAS ADVOCATED BY LUTHER KING,  
SAYING THAT THIS LINE WAS INEFFECTIVE, MARTIN LUTHER KING DID NOT  
PREACH VIOLENCE BUT HE WAS THE VICTIM OF VIOLENCE. HE DID NOT  
UNLEASH VIOLENCE BUT VIOLENCE MOVED HIM DOWN.

```
RADIO HABANA, 7 APRIL 68, 7:00 P.M. - JOHNSON POSTPONED HIS TRIP. HE CALLED THE CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS - WHO WERE MORE OR LESS UNDER CONTROL - TO GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE. JOHNSON APPEARED ON TELEVISION. HE EXPRESSED HIS ANGUISH AND HIS SORROW. HE MADE INSPIRED COMMENTS ABOUT MARTIN LUTHER KING. THESE ACTIONS AND THESE WORDS HIDE FEAR OVER THE WAVE OF JUST VIOLENCE WHICH IS STARTING TO SPREAD THROUGH THE UNITED STATES. WHAT A TIME WHEN COMPLEX INTER-
NATIONAL NEGOTIATIONS MIGHT BE UNDERWAY, UNDER DIFFICULT CONDITIONS. THIS NEW CRIME WIDENS THE CHASM WHICH DIVIDES THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES AND INCITES THE PEOPLE TO PROMOTE DISTURBANCES WHOSE FAR-REACHING EFFECTS ARE HARD TO PREDICT. THE ASSASSINATION OF MARTIN LUTHER KING CONFIRMS THAT THE VIOLENCE OF IMPERIALIST RACISTS IS ONLY ANSWERED EFFECTIVELY WITH THE VIOLENCE OF THE REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE.

### PROCESSING

**TO:** Chief, WH Division  
**FROM:** Chief of Station, Santo Domingo  
**DATE:** 10 Apr 68  
**SUBJECT:** Comments on the Death of Martin Luther King  
**REFERENCE:** "Black Power" Concept  

---

1. Attached for Headquarters retention are one copy each of statements on the death of Martin Luther King by the Dominican Communist Party (PCD), the Communist 14th of June Revolutionary Movement (MR-14), and various trade unions. All appeared in the 7 April 1968 issue of *El Nacional*.

2. The text of the PCD statement makes reference to the visit of Stokely Carmichael to the Latin American Solidarity Organization Conference (LASO), quotes a statement by Fidel Castro on Carmichael and the concept of "Black Power," and expresses the solidarity of the PCD with the struggle of North American Negroes. The MR-14 statement, only available in print, says that King's death reveals the profound crisis existing within US society and shows that for the "racist" forces, violence is the only law and is applied to internal and external enemies alike.

3. Neither statement issues a call to violence on the part of US Negroes.

# Condenan Asesinato De Martin Luther King

Dos organizaciones inquisitoriales condenaron hoy la muerte del reverendo Martin Luther King, el Partido Comunista Dominicano y el Movimiento Revolucionario 14 de Junio. 

El PCP señalaba que esto era una continuación de la política imperialista que "conduce a la guerra y la desestabilización".

Por su parte el 14 de Junio comentaron que al asesinato del Premio Nobel de la Paz revelado "la profunda crisis en que ha entrado la sociedad contemporánea". 
   
Asimismo, añadían, el 14 de Junio, que: "Para las bestias rastreras la violencia es la única respuesta" y consideraron que "todo enemigo interno opone resistencia a lo que se revela contra el imperio brutal".

De acuerdo con un artículo de Ekelso Carmicheal, que explicó: "cuando la historia de los mártires que padecen los pueblos de la violencia se escriba"...

# PARTIDO COMUNISTA DOMINICANO (PCD)

¡Nuestra solidaridad plena con la lucha de los negros norteamericanos, como parte que es de la lucha de todos los oprimidos de la tierra!

El régimen de los monopolios imperialistas norteamericanos se examina por la acción de los pueblos que defienden con valentía su frente y, desde dentro, el espíritu revolucionario por los derechos civiles y por la paz. Es el testimonio de Luther King; será presentado como la labor de la mano de los que ejercitan la acción civil por la violencia, de los interesados en la lucha organizada, y que comprenden los objetivos de esa lucha, de los monopolios imperialistas.

La violencia engendra violencia; muchos estilos de opresión, ella representa más que en los últimos años, y evidentemente, intensifica la respuesta a las restricciones, es el papel de Doctor King y de los racistas que, como todos, han sido económicamente abnegados, un hecho de paz que ha llegado a comprender por todos los oprimidos a las mayores, como represalias en su tiempo y minuto.

> El escuadrón, como los Estados Unidos al sector más expuesto de “la clase obrera” en el nivel de bienestar, en las diferencias sociales que aún forman raíces, es la propia acción de los que participan en su efecto, en las clases sociales; por lo que la discriminación y las pequeñas luchas que deben ser resueltas, es por lo que esencialmente se funden los comprometidos por las propias masas blancas que aún reclaman civiles de la población de raza africana marginada de la sociedad.

ARIS, 6 de abril. (AFP). El alza de los disturbios raciales en Estados Unidos, cuya primera

# ¡PROTESTAMOS POR EL ASESINATO  
DE MARTIN LUTHER KING!  
¡SOLIDARIDAD CON LOS NEGROS EN LUCHA!

Martin Luther King, líder pacifista del movimiento negro norteamericano, Premio Nobel de la Paz, ha sido asesinado por los opresores de su pueblo y de todos los pueblos explotados del Mundo.

> Su muerte "luchar por la liberación de los negros", contra la discriminación racial, contra las vejaciones y la opresión que sufren sus hermanos en el régimen de los Estados Unidos. Es el crímen que la carga que los demás países permiten para el mal todos aquellos que resisten, que lucha por la libertad.

A la medida en que el mundo proporciona evidencia en forma alarmante hacia donde puede llevar los hechos precisos que controlan el poder en los Estados Unidos.

> La violencia rebelde de los negros y de todos los demócratas corren de nuevo a estremecer la conciencia norteamericana.

La solidaridad internacional con su causa se expresa en múltiples formas.

> Y nosotros, los obreros dominicanos, elevamos nuestra voz de protesta y llamamos a las entidades que reconocen toda clasificación de lucha, según el derecho de los Estados Unidos, expresé el repudio a ese hecho bochornoso.

> Adoptamos esta actitud colectiva de que asumimos la protesta mundial como una labor solidaria hacia los negros.

> Los trabajadores negros, y de que somos dignos de frente a los poderosos, que no temen más que con el mismo odio, deben lamentar la muerte del líder negro, mientras permanecen las bayanas para tratar de desplazar la lucha deseada, así.

> Nada han hecho los regímenes obligados a sustentar en realidad la protesta por el asesinato de Luther King. Muchos intervinieron, hubieron resiliencias, a la acción justiciera de los lás cabichos terminados con la vida de Johnson o este maestro de la explotación imperialista. Pero Luther King era representante de los negros explotados, los luchadores por los derechos civiles de los negros, que al fin, no requieren nombre alguno.

> Sin embargo, Luther King es nosotros a sus representantes dominicanos, la que estamos encerrados en esta tierra la insensibilidad del trabajo y del progreso de toda la humanidad. Y por eso, en esa ocasión, también damos un paso al frente:

- MANTENEMOS LA SOLIDARIDAD ACTIVA HASTA QUE NUESTROS HERMANOS NEGROS DE LOS ESTADOS UNIDOS CONQUISTEN TODOS SUS DERECHOS.

Surveillance on IDEN C

---

**ACTION REQUIRED:** For your information 

---

1. **IDEN A**, a cleared and willing contact, provided the following information which was obtained during a surveillance of IDEN C. The surveillance was a joint effort of IDEN A and local ODENY. ODENY is not aware that IDEN A has passed the information to JMVAWE.

2. On Thursday, **19 May 1966**, a surveillance was instituted from Room 618 of IDEN B on adjoining Room 620, which was occupied by IDEN C and his aide IDEN D. The surveillance was initiated at 11:00 a.m. and terminated at 5:15 p.m. During the conversation between IDEN C and D and another unknown Negro male, believed to be IDEN E, references were made to the Florida Gubernatorial Race, a trip to Miami, and several miscellaneous sex experiences.

3. On **20 May 1966** a search was made of rooms 620 and 622 after IDENS C and D moved out. Forwarded under separate cover are copies of items found in the waste baskets and dressers; a hotel bill, and a list of telephone numbers which were called on 18 - 19 May 1966.

4. Of special interest among these items was a note which stated, IDEN F, please call Long Distance Operator IDEN G. IDEN H, according to IDEN A, is an identified member of the Communist Party. Also, an envelope of IDEN B with the name IDEN F. This person may have been one of the occupants of the room who remained in the company of IDEN C and D overnight.

5. JMVAWE traces were negative on all personalities mentioned above as well as those names appearing in the date forwarded under separate cover. JMVAWE has carded only those personalities who reside in the JMVAWE area.

This Agency has received the following information on subject from a source who is considered reliable: Martin Luther King, Jr. met with various leaders of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) and of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) on 18 September 1964. He discussed with these Italian politicians the prospects for demonstrations; also, suggestions in the United States which are to be organized in Italy during the months immediately ahead. He reportedly conferred with PCI Senator Velio Spano and with PSI Senator Paolo Verzielli, and with Luigi Lazzari of the Italian Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity (PSIUP).

3. This Agency is unable to evaluate the above report.

4. The information in paragraph two has been made available to your agency's representative in Rome.

# SUBJECT: Article by Martin Luther King in Vie Nuove  
22 October 1964

1. The article entitled "What We Negroes Ask of the President" and attributed to Martin Luther King, published on pages 15 and 17 of the 22 October 1964 issue of the Italian Communist Party organ Vie Nuove, is a straightforward expression of the hopes and aspirations of the American Negro population and of its determination to continue the struggle by non-violent means until full social and economic equality has been obtained. The article does not contain anything which could be considered as typical communist propaganda nor anything that seems to be directed specifically to a communist audience. The article, under King's byline, would be perfectly proper for any American publication.

2. At the beginning of the article, Vie Nuove includes the following editorial comment:  
   > The racial problem is one of the subjects that most divides the American states in this presidential election. This article, by Martin Luther King, that we published exclusively, illuminates its most dramatic aspects and expresses the requests that the colored population advances to the entire nation. It is a denunciation of the inequality of rights that goes beyond the secular racial question. The "you must respect my person" is a request that the problem of Democracy poses for everyone.

3. Despite the date of its publication the article appears to have been written some months ago. This is evident from King's reference in the article to the fact that the Civil Rights Bill was before Congress at the time he was writing the article. The Bill, it will be recalled, was enacted into law on 2 July 1964. The conclusion to be drawn from this is that the article's appearance in Vie Nuove, at least, its composition by King, is not the direct RESULT of any contacts that King may have had with PCI officials during his visit to Rome in mid-September.

# Carri armati a Jackson

**di Martin Luther King**

---

**Rinascita pag. 32**  
**21 ottobre 1964**  
**Testimonianze**

Martin Luther King Jr., leader del movimento dei diritti civili, ha dichiarato che vi è una nuova situazione e che i diritti civili sono stati distrutti. Dal punto di vista teorico, si comprende che la Nazione affronta la parte centrale che riguardano le responsabilità e l'attività di governo, le forze armate e i diritti civili.

Per molti anni, nel passato, la lotta per i diritti civili è stata soltanto una questione di priorità nella municipalità di Jackson. Nel primo manifestarsi della civiltà, si è evidenziato che nella società contemporanea manca una profonda comprensione.

> Prima di tutto, è necessario stabilire che i diritti civili sono un diritto umano fondamentale. Negli Stati Uniti, la discriminazione già esiste nei vari settori e sta become un grave problema.

La situazione è diventata intollerabile. Nella policia si sono registrati eventi che hanno aggravato la quotidianità dei negri in trompe' nord del Sud; i negri vivono in uno stato di polizia che, paradossalmente, protegge solo un'unica parte. In tale sistematica violazione dei diritti civili, vi è una risposta eccezionale: molti hanno denunciato il governo federale, segnato da un processo di criminalizzazione.

Molti si domandano come mai le dimostrazioni e le lotte nel Sud tengano...

### For Your Information:

Following is a translation of a report on the subject of the Mission of Luther KING with the Italian Left, dated 28 September 1964, and attributed to DEPLENARY/7, from Lutgi PINTOR, from information coming into the editorial offices of L'UNITA. The Station received the report on 1 October 1964.

Luther KING, noted Protestant negro Pastor and leader of the antiracist movement in the United States, met with various leaders of the Italian Communist Party (PCT) and the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) on 18 September in Rome. In particular, KING conferred with PCT Senators Velio SPANO and Ugo BARTESAGHI, with Deputy Licio LUZZATTO, and Senator Paolo VITTORIELLI of the Italian Socialist Party. KING discussed with the above-named politicians the program of demonstrations against segregation in the United States, which are to be organized in Italy during the months immediately ahead. 

The same report was also received from DEDICATOR/4 who has access to the DEPLENARY establishment, and thus it is not considered as confirming the DEPLENARY/7 information.
