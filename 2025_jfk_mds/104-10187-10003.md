# 18 August 1964

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Technical Services Division  
ATTENTION: Chief, TSD/AM8  
SUBJECT: Request for TDY Replacement for Arnold F. AREIHART.

1. Our Division requests YOUR cooperation in providing a TDY replacement for Arnold F. AREIHART as Case Officer and technician for the LITVNY tap center in Mexico City. AREIHART has requested three weeks home leave, from 10 to 29 September, to drive his older son to the States to enroll him in his freshman year of college. AREIHART has kept his leave plans to a minimum so that his TDY replacement will need to be on loan from headquarters for as short a time as possible.

2. The Division had offered to provide an operations officer as a TDY replacement but Mexico City Station has requested that a technician be sent instead since the burden of AREIHART's job is the maintenance of equipment along with the protection of CIA's interests inside the [illegible: appears to be approximately 4 words/characters] "Mr. Charles Peck for this assignment would be ideal if he is available, as no overlap would be required since he is already knowledgeable of this operation. The Station was also very pleased with the work done by Mr. Peck on his last TDY to Mexico.

3. Because of the critical role the LITVNY Project plays in the Station's whole operational picture, and because of the importance the smooth functioning of the TF is to our liaison with tier-level Mexican officials, your assistance is requested. If Mr. Peck is not available, any other suitable candidate would be acceptable. Please inform Mr. Roustes, [illegible: appears to be approximately 4 words/characters] 4566, 4597 of your decision, as we would like to be able to inform Mexico as soon as possible as to whether a TDY replacement will be available.

# DISPATCH

**Chief of Station, Mexico City**

**To:** P. C. ARAUJO (ep)  
**Subject:** Reference 1892–2 (38) Date: 1 July 1964

1. Araujo P. ARAUJO (ep) would like to depart from Mexico on 10 September 1964 for home leave and return around mid-September. He does not wish to leave until it will be necessary to take his younger son out of school. His request will be submitted along in the usual channels with the reason ARAUJO request leave at this time.

2. A technical replacement would be preferable to an operating officer as a computer replacement for ARAUJO to keep running the usual amount of traffic reported in 1892. The requirements for securing a replacement are standard and the normal background checks will apply.

# DISPATCH

## Chief of Station, Mexico City

### Chief, HQS

### Replacement for Arnold F. ASHEART during Home Leave  
Reference: INMA 23522

1. Referenced dispatch which reflected the Station's appreciation of Newton T. RITSAY's high level of performance during his recent TDY in Mexico and requested his return TDY was brought to the attention of the appropriate KURLOT officials.

2. Unfortunately, RUSTAY will not be available to replace ASHEART during the latter's home leave period in the fall of 1964, and KURLOT has no one else they can release for a prolonged period this fall. Since the leave probably will only be about two months, headquarters wonders whether an operations officer, with some Spanish and who could merely take over the administrative work and speak the Station contacts, could fill in during this period?

3. We are not sanguine that a replacement can be made available particularly since the man will of necessity need to be "acceptable" to liaison, but will try our best to find one. In the meantime, please forward the exact dates it is desired the hoped-for man should be in Mexico to allow for adequate overlap.

> Cuestor P. DAINOLD

To: Chief of Station, Mexico City  
From: Chief, WH Division  
Subject: LINKUP SUPPORT  
Action Required: Reference

1. Arnold J. AREHART asked that his TDY replacement inquire at Headquarters regarding the status of his request for equipment which the Station forwarded to Headquarters as Requisition No. 353p-19-64. Headquarters has shipped to Corpus Christi the items he requested in connection with the Revere (shipped 20 April), and the Heath and Allied items were shipped on 7 May. The Ampex and B-10 items have not yet been received at Headquarters from the supplier. Headquarters will touch all items from these that weight and size will permit; the remainder will have to be shipped to Corpus Christi. In view of the equipment listed in LGIS 6020, 18 May 1964, which is also awaiting pickup at Corpus Christi, perhaps there will be a flight soon.

2. It is requested that the above information be passed to AREHART.

# 26 May
## 26 May 1966

### MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, TSD/AOB
### SUBJECT: 1 LIENVOY TDY Report

1. **TDY support of the LIENVOY operation in Mexico City was provided by this office during the period 23 April to 15 May 1966.** The Staff Agent, ARNOLD F. AREHART who manages this operation underwent surgery for a hernia on the 24th of April. The undersigned assumed the responsibilities and performed the duties associated with the LIENVOY operation during AREHART’s convalescence. He was incapacitated for duty from 23 April until 12 May. His operation was successful and recovery was normal. AREHART returned to work on 12 May in a weakened condition and three days of overlap was allowed to provide assistance with the more strenuous and tiresome chores.

2. The LIENVOY installation was found to be in excellent condition. The operating personnel were well disciplined and their procedures were well organized. The daily work was being accomplished in a business like and efficient manner. AREHART has done a commendable job in establishing and maintaining this highly productive operation.

3. The equipment in this installation has been in use fifteen hours a day for over four years. As the result of good maintenance practices it is in good shape and functioning well. The minor difficulties encountered during the shake down period have been overcome and equipment maintenance and repair pose no significant problems. There was no loss of coverage on any days during the three week TDY.

4. The following observations and recommendations are included herein to improve KURIOT services to the Field and to acquaint responsible officers with technical discrepancies.

   A. Pertinent technical information is not being communicated to AREHART.

B. The drying up of the ball point pens in the B-10, Dial Recorder has been a constant nuisance since the beginning of this operation. The pressure sensitive tape was the obvious answer to this problem, but the first ten rolls of pressure tape were received after nearly four years of struggling with the defective pens. It is recommended that pressure sensitive tape be supplied to this operation for future use.

C. The tea rolls of pressure sensitive tape received during this TDY were wound backwards on their spindles.

D. The tires on the idler wheel of the B-10 are drying and cracking and fail to obtain adequate traction on the flywheel. This causes tape feed problems. It is recommended that three dozen new idler wheels be pounced to ARCHERART immediately. Several of the defective idler wheels are available in this office for inspection.

In connection Venezuelan complaint to OAS, discussions in Standing Group of NSC have identified two alternatives for cooperative system surveillance and interception of vessels and aircraft engaged in transporting arms for subversive purposes to Latin America (especially Caribbean area) directly or indirectly from Cuba. Difference between alternatives centers on need for OAS authorization for use of force in international waters.

> 2. Alternative A would require OAS authorization use of force in connection with visit-and-search in international waters against selected Cuban vessels and selected vessels OAS countries. It would be a cooperative system of surveillance and interception involving visit-and-search in international waters on a selective basis, with force to be used if necessary. Visit-and-search and, if resistance met, force would be applied by naval units of US or of cooperating OAS countries against selected vessels suspected of transporting arms from Cuba, directly or indirectly.

3. Alternative B would not require OAS authorization. Use of force as visit-and-search would take place only within territorial waters. It would be a cooperative system of surveillance and interception involving visit-and-search only within the territorial waters of an OAS country, with force to be applied, if necessary, by that country's forces or by forces of another OAS country acting under a bilateral agreement. Control of suspect vessels destined for non-OAS country or territory (e.g., British Guiana) would depend on cooperation that country.

4. In both alternatives interception or seizure of suspect aircraft would be carried out only in territory of OAS country of destination by forces of that country or of another OAS country acting under a bilateral agreement.

5. Comparison of alternatives:
   - (a) Alternative A would be much harder to sell to OAS countries than Alternative B because authorization for use of force required.
   - (b) Alternative A would be somewhat more effective both in fact and as deterrent than Alternative B, although both can be circumvented.
   - (c) Alternative A would constitute harassment of Castro whereas Alternative B is purely defensive.
   - (d) Alternative A would incur substantially greater risks of escalation than Alternative B.

(a) Alternative A would be more expensive in terms of US units required than Alternative B.

6. Kind and number of *institutional measures which we would seek in OAS would vary with choice between alternatives. For example, our tentative thinking is that maximum OAS package acceptable to US under Alternative A would be: authorization use force; continuation Castro regime; and reaffirmation in a *organization anti-subversive measures. Under Alternative B, such package now estimated to be: defensive system with search for *within national territory; condemnation; reaffirmation anti-*subversive; and obligatory break in air and surface communications between OAS countries and Cuba.

7. We consider attitude Mexico and Brazil critical. OAS vote authorizing use force in which one or other did not join would be politically undesirable. END FYI.

8. Action requested:
Chief of Mission should take first opportunity of conversation with FonMin on other matters to explore discreetly and informally indicating he acting personally and without instructions the probable receptivity of OAS (OAS) to an OAS resolution authorizing use force.

## TEXAS SCORES ON POLITICS, CUBA EXCLUSION

Havana in English to ENVEZ 2200 GMT 11 December 1963-E

(Prt) Mexico City—Mexican Foreign Minister Manuel Tello criticized the constitution of the OAS, saying that it is in a state of crisis. Tello also criticized the exclusion of Cuba from that organization. In the interview with the local daily NOVEDADES, Foreign Minister Tello said that Cuba's exclusion from the OAS is not in conformity with the OAS charter. He noted that the charter does not contain the exclusion of any member state.

Regarding the present international situation of the OAS, Tello emphasized that an organization which does not have "trial of fraternity" cooperation, and tolerance is likely to face a crisis. The Mexican foreign minister stated that in the present state of the OAS, the elements or bases for the organization to strengthen remain do not exist. He pointed out that contrary to conventions adopted at Chapultepec and Cancun, almost all the present Latin American representatives to the OAS are also their countries' ambassadors in Washington.

## URGENT INTERCEDES FOR BOLIVIAN HOSTAGES

Lima AFP in Spanish 2357 GMT 11 December 1963—F OFFICIAL USE ONLY

(Excerpts) Mexico City—Arturo Jauregui, secretary general of the Regional Confederation of Labor, the labor union organization (Organización Regional de Trabajadores de América-Latina), sent a personal request to Bolivian Vice President Juan Lechin on behalf of the foreigners held at Catavi as hostages.

The cable says: "I appeal to your labor union principles in the name of 1,000 militant labor member tutures in favor of the hostages. These persons are well known as militants working in favor of the spirit of humanity and social economic progress. The Bolivian revolution," the message adds, "demands that its practice and validation be held high."

## PANAMA
12 December 1933

David la Vos del Peru in Spain: 21:00 GMT 11 December 1933

(Press commentary)

(Here) It appears as if a preconceived plan of terrorism, last known before in Panama, has been unleashed since rebels of our armed forces were at Fort Galli. The barbarous death of labor leader Egüilar, beaten and kicked in Puerto Armuelles; the beating of Trade Labor Leader Paredes Salinas; the decapitation through a newspaper of a labor leader who was hanged and beaten in Colón; another case in Balboa; and many other known cases constitute irrefutable proof of the plan.

If the objective of the wave of persecution is to attack the kinds of men with bullets, sticks, imprisonment, and other similar measures, it is a stupid way, because ideas are fraught with ideas. If some of the humble classes try to protect their rights, they are called terrorists. The privileged classes have used frequently the strangest against the working classes. If we analyze the situation we will see how the privileged classes have maintained their own monopolistic organization.

The oligarchic groups have greatly increased. Yesterday they could be represented in the two or three existing parties which were directed and governed by them; today, they have seen the need to increase the number of political parties, as much as 20 in a small country, in order to control the public administration. Each party is formed by a privileged family whose only wish is to extend its life of leisure and luxury. The kind of life calls for plenty of money, so in order to obtain the money they need they increase each day the taxation of the poor, who must pay and thus sink deeper into poverty, diseases, and ignorance.

If the people do not have work, they cannot earn money; and if they do not have money they cannot pay taxes. If the people try to organize in self-defense, they are accused of being communists, and they are fought with bullets. If the cause of all the evils of democracy is communism, the solution is obvious, it is him who invented communism, and who is behind secret societies to destroy it and publish it. The way to fight communism is to open sources of work to build schools, hospitals, and better roads.

# The Rapacki Plan

1. The Polish proposal for a Central European nuclear-free zone was introduced at the 2 October 1957 session of the UN General Assembly by the Polish Foreign Minister, Adam Rapacki. Acting as spokesman for the Polish Government, he formulated the proposal: should both East and West Germany agree to a ban on the production and storage of nuclear weapons on their territories, Poland would simultaneously introduce an identical ban on her territory. Rapacki did not mention Czechoslovakia, but the head of the Czechoslovak UN delegation, speaking after Rapacki, supported his proposal, declaring that his country would join the agreement, extending the ban over her territory, too. The East Germans subsequently warmly endorsed the proposal.

2. Rapacki's proposal had obviously been cleared and coordinated with Soviet leaders prior to its introduction. Moscow promptly reported the proposal approvingly and the Soviet press stressed that such an agreement would be welcomed by the peoples of Europe, would facilitate agreement on disarmament and cessation of nuclear tests, and would "help improve relations and bring closer together" the two German states.

3. The proposal was formalized in a 9 December 1957 Polish government memorandum, which was presented by Rapacki to the US, British, and French ambassadors in Warsaw. The then Soviet Premier, Bulganin, promptly endorsed the proposal in a series of letters to heads of governments throughout the world.

4. In 1958 Rapacki modified his plan, allegedly to make it more palatable to the Western powers. The new version of the plan, published in November 1958, called for a two-stage program, in which: (1) current nuclear stockpiles and bases would be frozen and production of nuclear weapons would be banned in Poland, Czechoslovakia, East and West Germany, and (2) existing nuclear stockpiles and weapons would be

eliminated as a part of a general disarmament agreement for the four-nation area. The revised version of the plan also called for "air and ground control" with NATO and Warsaw Pact countries participating in the control system.

5. Polish leaders have since 1957 pressed for a formal agreement on the Rapacki plan. Shortly after the opening of the Geneva disarmament conference in March 1962, the Polish delegation submitted a memorandum urging creation of a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe. The memorandum basically follows the lines of the former proposals of the Rapacki plan. The Soviet delegation is currently urging that the Geneva disarmament conference take up the question of nuclear-free zones in various areas of the world.

6. Since the Rapacki plan was introduced, it has had strong support from Moscow. The Soviets have even urged extending the zone to include Baltic and Balkan countries. Soviet leaders undoubtedly view the proposal as a means of eliminating German power in Central Europe—one of Moscow's major foreign policy objectives.

7. The US strongly opposes the Rapacki plan, viewing it as a Bloc device to neutralize Germany, to deepen and even perpetuate the division of Germany, and to secure de facto recognition of East Germany. Implementation of the proposal would also be militarily disadvantageous to the West. US military power in Europe would be diminished without a concurrent decrease of Soviet strength. It would weaken NATO.

8. The West German government is also vigorously opposed to the Rapacki plan and all such "disengagement" plans in Central Europe for the same reasons. Bonn also considers such proposals as sinister and subtly intimidatory to the West Germans, who do not choose to be dealt with as if they were inert objects, and who detect in such schemes a creation of conditions for their eventual communization.

9. Public endorsement of the Rapacki plan by the Mexican president would mark the first such specific approval by a government leader outside the Soviet Bloc. His endorsement would be widely propagandized by the Poles and the Soviets and could set a precedent for them to secure such approval by other nonbloc leaders.

2. Attachment A. This is a list of references to pertinent articles in specific issues of the "Current Intelligence Weekly Summaries."

3. Attachment B. With the exception of the items on Cuba, these KUWOLF-prepared materials were not sent to Station Mexico City. They may be used to promote the ODYIE position on the Common Market, the Berlin problem, Cuba, etc.

4. Attachment C. KUWOLF compiled these materials. They include a current description of the situation in each country involved and biographic sketches on many of the officials with whom LITINSOR will probably meet during his trip. The biographic information has been taken from KUDARK and DAPID files. The Station should not pass any biographic information through which a line has been drawn on those attachments.

## 4. CULMINATION - Subject is an individual, alert, responsive and demonstrates an pronounced interest in the field, and is a willing participant. As a result of this, the subject's activity in the classroom shows that he is a reliable, productive member in this, along with his peers. It is believed that he has the ability to apply the concepts learned in the classroom to practical work. Recently, it has been observed that he has shown no reluctance in well-intent work. 

### 5. SALMAS - Subject seems to possess an average aptitude for academic work. Like the others, he was always willing, took his active part in the class discussions. His written work has shown inconsistencies in acceptable manner. In the moments that he would make a mistake, it appeared that he would make no similar error again, including the occasions when he clearly conversed.

### 6. MURCHIN - Like SALMAS, Subject is capable and intelligent, and he seems to get along well with his fellow workers. His willingness to be communicative, as it is believed will depend on his interest to develop dramatically in this area. In many discussions and in his writing, he seems to make the decisions in the classroom without any labors involved in recruiting and handling of certain activities, and possesses a capability of composure that might result in proposals.

> It is believed that with a practical consideration to any proposed operation with a security point of view before executing, his written exercises were well thought, stating that he gave them considerable time and attention.

# 7. Case - *Substance* and *Communications* Program

The *Substance* and *Communications* program is a very valuable, effective, and comprehensive program that provides the participant with invaluable insights. This program enables participants to communicate effectively with others. 

---

## 6. Comments

1. The above comments, it should be noted, are based on a rather much observation period; they should be considered accordingly. The size of the group, however, is larger than usual for one instructor; it is recommended that the instructor spend less time with each trainee. The writer appreciates the opportunity to work with this group and enjoys it tremendously; he considers this a valuable step in his own and others' growth.

2. The problems faced with the expressed wish to name us were minimal, while the interaction with peers remained high. The intent was to make the most of that aspect; it is suggested that additional parameters be added here. It is recommended that the remaining time be used wisely.

3. Finally, the writer wishes to thank all individuals for pleasant cooperation and support; without the teamwork, the execution and coordination would have compromised the overall conduct of the course substantially.

A copy of all the training materials was left with Lily by 1992 for the time as previously requested. It can be made which the next two or four weeks to review the materials in a more or less direct classroom situation. Furthermore, it is suggested that such time as their bases expand, we will train and carry on surveillance and other exercises designed to improve their capability.

**ACTION REQUIRED:** For Your Information  
**REFERENCE:** DIRECTOR-65353, 12 January 1969  

1. As indicated in Reference and other communications, a training request was made by the Station and approved by Headquarters, to train a group under the LIENVoy Project to follow up on leads produced by the joint LIENVoy operation and presumably other Mexican Government unilateral sources. Lee R. WYLECHRIANE, WOMOLO instructor who was assigned to the Mexico City Station until 8 July 1968, was selected as the instructor. WYLECHRIANE arrived in Mexico City on 9 January 1969; the training began on 13 January and ended on 10 February 1969. The training was conducted at a training site, Calle Tabasco #228, Colonia Roma, Postal Zone 7, Mexico City, provided by LIENVoy-2 and LIELEGANT; the building in which the training site apartment is located is owned by LIELEGANT, and the latter and LIENVoy-2 have their offices there. The unit, upon completion of the training, will use the apartment in which the training was conducted for their offices.

2. The LIENYO's had originally requested that five (5) of their men be trained. However, upon arrival in Mexico City and just prior to the scheduled beginning of the training they requested that they be permitted to add one man and that two men be included in the class from the Dirección Federal de Seguridad (DFS). In the latter case, they submitted three names but said that only two of the three would be expected to attend the class. As it turned out all three of the latter group turned up, thus bringing the class to nine (9) students, five (5) Army officers, one civilian from the LIENYO group, and the three DFS men. Following is a list of the trainees:

1. Felix LOZANO Rangel, DFS, age 35.  
2. Javier MALCERA Fuentes, DFS, age 33.  
3. Esteban GUJNA Salgado, DFS, age 33.  
4. Leonardo LOPEZ LOPEZ, age 23.  
5. Felipe TREJO Gonzalez, Lt. Col., Mexican Army, age 46.  
6. Mariano CHANTRES Molina, Captain, Mexican Army, age 39.  
7. Ladislao SALINAS Alor, Captain, Mexican Army, age 31.  
8. Jorge MARGAIN Ortiz, Captain, Mexican Army, age 29.  
9. Rogelio Rafael GARZA Hernandez, Lieutenant, Mexican Army, age 26.  

3. The training objective of the program was to familiarize the trainees with the basic tradecraft principles and techniques involved in the conduct of clandestine activities, with primary emphasis on the work and activities of security services. Although largely tutorial in nature, numerous exercises were conducted in Mexico City, including two live problems which will be explained later in this dispatch, to further familiarize trainees with techniques involved in surveillance, counter-surveillance, personnel meetings, debriefs, interrogation, and investigation. The course included: discussion and reading material on opposition to clandestine activities, organization and functions of a security service, personal, physical and organization security; cover, concealment and compartmentation, as well as the basic operational skills of observation, description, ceasing, surveillance, and elicitation and interviewing. Considerable time was spent on reporting and clandestine communications, as well as on agent acquisition and agent handling.  

4. With the agreement of LIITEMPO-1 [who said verbally that he had consulted with Hector SENTES Rodriguez, who is known to have had clandestine contact with the Soviets, for interrogation. He was detained on the street near his home on the early morning of 4 February 1969 and interrogated throughout the day at a motel, the Pablo Alito, located at K 14 on the Mexico City-Toluca highway. The other six (6) trainees were able to overhear the entire interrogation but did not actually take part for security reasons. They did not see SENTES nor did the latter see them. In line with the discussions and received material, this live interrogation was of great value to them. Also on 3 February 1969 LIENYO-2 passed along to MYWITHCLAR a good lead concerning Carlos PEREZ Aguirre, a young Mexican, who also has contact with the Soviets and Cubans. Unfortunately, only one-half day could be spent on investigating

this lead, but even this was of value to the trainees. One trainee was required to make a pretext telephone call, another team of two made a neighborhood check, and the remainder were divided into teams to check with Transito, the Ministry of Defense, the Social Security Institute and the Information Police. Except for the last team, all picked up some information of value, and the information and its significance in terms of the projected investigation of PEREZ was discussed with them.

5. The performance of the class as a whole was remarkably good. The three DFS men, because of their previous training and experience, were able to absorb and understand the lectures and reading material much more quickly than the others. None of the others had any previous training or experience in intelligence or security work. However, they were keenly interested, actively participated in classroom discussions and field services, and all prepared their written work in an acceptable manner. The instructor reviewed all written work with them, as well as plans for meetings, etc., and this proved most helpful. Somewhat unusual for Latins, all students were punctual; there were some very small and unimportant absences, but for the most part these were due to the exceedingly difficulty traffic situation in Mexico City or to other reasons apparently beyond their control. No student was absent from classes during the entire training period, and no student was late for more than 15 minutes or an hour.

6. In summary, the instructor and the training team felt that the training objective was accomplished, and that the trainees, although not experienced operatives, had a sufficient enough understanding of the basic tradecraft principles and techniques to point them to begin operations. They are all intelligent and alert men, and except for LOPEZ LOPEZ all have an Army background. CHIANES is quite imaginative and resourceful, but also quite cautious and concerned about the possibility of slips and compromises. He gets along well with all his fellow workers, and undoubtedly has real leadership qualities. TREJO is somewhat talkative, opinionated and argumentative, and may have trouble supervising others, but he, too, demonstrated considerable imagination and resourcefulness. GARZA, the youngest of the Army group, appeared to be the most pro-American, is very imaginative, and possesses considerable drive and energy. On one occasion he had the instructor out to lunch at his home, where he lives with his wife (they have no children). He commented on numerous occasions about his many (almost annual) shopping trips to San Antonio, where his wife has a number of close relatives. GARZA, it is believed, would probably be the most susceptible to development and possible recruitment of the group.

7. Except for the remarks in paragraph 6 above, no individual assessment will be forwarded herewith. The instructor has prepared a memorandum on each man, including the DFS group, setting forth his observations and opinions, as well as any information he was able to obtain on the trainees.

8. MICHAIRANE used the name "Sr. Tomas" with the trainees; so far as is known they did not learn this true name, nor were they aware where he was living in Mexico City. Likewise, they are not aware that he has served previously in Mexico. There were no incidents involving security during the training period, and no other incidents or events that should be reported.

WHILE MOSCOW CONTINUES TO MANIFEST GENUINE CONCERN OVER POSSIBLE US ACTION TO INTERDICT SOVIET SHIPMENTS TO CUBA, SOVIET FOREIGN MINISTER GROMYKO IN HIS 21 SEPTEMBER UN ADDRESS NOTED WITH SATISFACTION PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S STATEMENT THAT MILITARY INTERVENTION COULD NOT BE JUSTIFIED AT THE PRESENT TIME. MOSCOW IS EVIDENTLY TRYING TO BUILD A CASE TO SUPPORT ITS POSITION CHARGING IN THE UN THAT THE US IS GUILTY OF "PROVOCATIVE ACTIVITIES" THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

2. RECENT SOVIET PUBLIC STATEMENTS SUGGEST THAT KHRUSHCHEV IS STILL NOT COMMITTED TO A FIRM COURSE OF ACTION ON BERLIN AND CONTINUES TO PROBE AND ASSESS WESTERN REACTION TO SOVIET MOVES. ON THE OTHER HAND, MOSCOW SEEMS INTENT ON CONVINCING THE ALLIED POWERS THAT IT HAS NOT RETREATED FROM A COMMITMENT TO A MULTILATERAL SETTLEMENT IN NEGOTIATIONS.

Chinas, though still talking about return to mainland, are unlikely to launch any operations larger than small-scale intelligence probes in the foreseeable future. Both sides adhere to basic policy position that "two Chinas" solution is out of the question, and that the only possible solution is destruction, absorption rival regime.

4. **India-China:** Recent clashes on Assam-Tibet frontier have refocused attention on eastern end of Himalayan borders and heightened Sino-Indian tension; skirmishing likely to continue both in Ladakh and Northeast, but onset of wetter conditions in mid-October and apparent reluctance of both sides to extend fighting makes outbreak of large-scale hostilities unlikely.

**SUBJECT**:  
Material for Passage to Liaison

**ACTION REQUIRED**:  
REVIEW

1. Attached are two copies of General Alberto Bayo's book (in Spanish) for use in briefing or training agents or members of security forces with which we have liaison. This book is a "do-it-yourself" guide to paramilitary and sabotage techniques. It demonstrates Cuban support for such activities and the need for training in counter-measures by friendly security forces.

2. Headquarters has recommended that all **Stations** have one or more of these books, especially those where official or unofficial liaison exists with a security force.  

3. In the Station Mexico is interested in this book, a limited number of copies can be obtained. Prior to releasing any of these copies, Headquarters must know the individual and service receiving the book, thereby allowing its clearance release.
