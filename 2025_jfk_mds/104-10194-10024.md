# MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Support

## SUBJECT: Request for Excerpts to Provision of PR 45-10b — Terence S. CRABANAC (P)

1. This memorandum contains recommendations in paragraph 5 for the approval of the Deputy Director for Support.

2. Terence S. CRABANAC (P) is a Contract Employee assigned to the Madrid area in Spain in a sensitive assignment since his conversion from a Staff Employee on 4 July 1965. CRABANAC was G-15, step 7 ($19,680.00 per annum) and is being paid at the same rate in his present contract assignment. His contract provides that he will not be entitled to a living quarters allowance in accordance with regulations of this organization applicable to its appointed personnel.

3. The basic living quarters allowance for Class II officers in Madrid is $2,900 per annum. The house which CRABANAC has located, with a year lease from 15 November 1965 to 14 November 1966, has an annual rent of $6,600.00 excluding utilities. Therefore, for rent alone, he will be $1,800.00 per year over the 10 percent maximum allowed under the provisions of PR 45-10b. On a 75/25 percent sharing basis of the 50 percent over the quarters allowance, he would be out of pocket $2,395.00.

4. Due to the operational sensitivity of CRABANAC's assignment, his request for relief on his housing costs was handled by Mr. Thomas Karmaszeski, AMDP. On 16 September 1965, Mr. Karmaszeski, AMDP, approved his being reimbursed on a 75/30 percent basis for the excess allowable costs up to, but not to exceed, 60 percent above his quarters allowance. This authorization was included in a letter to CRABANAC from Mr. Karmaszeski. It is requested that the Deputy Director

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Thomas H. Karanessines  
SUBJECT: Madrid Housing

1. The following is a listing of the GS-13 and above staff employees and their quarters costs as of April 1965:

| Grade & No. of Dependent    | Allowance | Cost   | Cost to Individual             |
|------------------------------|-----------|--------|--------------------------------|
| (COS) GS-16 (3)              | $2,900    | $4,236 | All cost paid                  |
| GS-15 (1)                    | 2,900     | 3,132  | $116                           |
| GS-15 (0)                    | 2,000     | 1,800  | 0                              |
| GS-14 (5)                    | 2,900     | 2,796  | 0                              |
| GS-14 (5)                    | 2,900     | 3,840  | $450                           |
| GS-13 (3)                    | 2,000     | 2,280  | $140                           |
| GS-13 (5)                    | 2,000     | 2,472  | $236                           |
| GS-13 (5)                    | 2,000     | 2,544  | $272                           |

2. Mr. Hunt's quarters allowance is $2,900. Using the same formula as applied to the other staff employees at the Station, the following would be the figures:

$2,900 + 60% ($1,740) = $4,640

On a 50/50 percent sharing basis of the 60 percent, he would be out-of-pocket $870 if his costs were $4,610.

On a 75/25 percent sharing basis of the 60 percent, he would be out-of-pocket $135, if his costs were $4,640.

3. I would recommend he be authorized the 75/25 percent sharing basis of the allowable excess costs up to, but not to exceed, 50 percent above his quarters allowance.

SUBJECT: General - Terrence S. CRABANAC - Supplement Specific - Paragraph Entitled "Offset"  
REFERENCE:  
A. OCC Option 65-24/768, dated 12 August 1965  
B. Our Memo, dated 8 July 1965, Same Subject  

1. This office herein recommends an amendment to CRABANAC's Supplement dated 8 July 1965, to delete paragraph 7, entitled "Offset."  

2. This office acknowledges the OCC option, Reference A, which determined CRABANAC may retain without Agency salary offset any future royalties earned as a result of his literary efforts based on the fact cover does not include role of a writer.  

3. As Subject's cover "activities" have been officially clarified as being only a light one of a retired Foreign Service Officer for which the Agency will be making all entitlement payments and actually he will receive no funds from any cover, this paragraph, which is misleading, has no meaning to Subject's contract and is hereby recommended that it be deleted from CRABANAC's Supplement.  

4. Further, in future cases when a cover is so light that Subject will not be receiving funds from cover it is recommended that no "Offset" paragraph be included in Supplements or Contracts.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Contract Personnel Division  
SUBJECT: Terence S. CRABANAC - Retention of Royalties by a Contract Employee

1. You have requested the opinion of this Office in regard to the retention of future royalties which might be earned by Terence S. CRABANAC as a result of his literary efforts. We believe that he is entitled to retain such royalties without an offset against his Agency salary.

2. We have been advised by Mr. Gene Stevens, WE/Support, that CRABANAC's cover does not include the role of a writer; CRABANAC's cover for status will only be a light one of a retired Foreign Service Officer. Therefore, paragraph 7 of his contract dated 4 July 1965 may remain as written. Royalties from the fictional works that he writes as a profitable hobby will not be emoluments received from or through his "cover activities."

**SUBJECT:** Terence S. Crabanac -- Retention of Royalties by a Contract Employee  

1. Reference is made to the telephone conversation of 26 July 1965 between yourself and Roger C. Brooks of this Office wherein background information relating to the assignment of Terence S. Crabanac was discussed.

2. Subject will apparently develop a cover as a writer, a field wherein he has an already demonstrated talent based upon several publications. The objective of the cover is to provide a basis of attribution for some of his income. At the time of the preparation of Mr. Crabanac's contract, the specific detail of his cover was unknown.

3. Request your opinion in regard to the retention of possible royalties earned by Crabanac as a result of his literary efforts or whether such income should be properly offset.

**MEMORANDUM FOR** Contract Personnel Division, O/P  
**SUBJECT:** 1 general - Terence B. Carabanac - Supplement specific - Paragraph Entitled "OFFSET"

1. This office has a question as to the intent of including paragraph (7.) entitled "OFFSET" as appears in the contract for Terence B. Carabanac. The paragraph in question reads as follows:

   7. OFFSET  
   Emoluments (including benefits in kind) received from or through your cover activities are the property of the U.S. Government. Procedurally, such emoluments will be offset against amounts due you under this agreement and are acknowledged to be paid by the Government hereunder and for Federal tax purposes. If cover emoluments exceed those due you under this contract, you will dispose of the excess amount in accordance with Governmental instructions.

2. Subject is reportedly proceeding abroad under the cover of a retired Foreign Service officer and in pursuit of his ambitions as a writer. Subject will receive all his contractual benefits through the Agency; there is no cover company, so therefore the only apparent emoluments to be received from articles, stories, or books written by him. Please info this office if interpretation is correct. If not, we would appreciate your interpretation and reasoning relative to the statement "Emoluments received from or through your cover activities are the property of the U.S. Government."

# MEMORANDUM TO: Benefits & Services Division
## SUBJECT: Cause of illness - E. Howard Hunt

1. Having been requested to give an opinion regarding the origins of the duodenal ulcer for which I was hospitalized October 12-15, 1964, I believe it to have resulted from three years of work frustration and professional disqualifications occasioned by (a) Agency failure to assign me to an appropriate post abroad [context: appears to be a technical term] and (b) the passive, non-challenging nature of the domestic work I was given.

2. I should point out that before joining Project WHATS in May, 1960, I requested in writing, and was granted by responsible senior official, commitment to return me to an appropriate assignment abroad upon the termination of WHATS. Despite continuing verbal assurances retained in domestic duties which I felt were inconsistent with the heavier responsibilities discharged by me during a long and active operational career abroad.

3. The P/O position I have been occupying - Chief of Covert Action for P/O Division - is the equivalent of my 1953-53 assignment as Chief of Covert Action for CI Division. Organizationally, I am where I was 11-12 years ago, but with a smaller staff and many fewer responsibilities.

4. To me this represented a professional dead-end, without hope of promotion or foreign assignment, a situation which precluded by mind and in due course found physical reflection in duodenal hemorrhage.

5. For the record, the foregoing information is not volunteered, but provided in response to an official request.
