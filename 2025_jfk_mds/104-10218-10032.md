# VALERIY VLADIMIROVICH KOSTIKOV
He is a 38-year-old officer of the KGB who occupies the cover position of Second Secretary. He first visited Mexico in 1959 for a Soviet Industrial Exposition and later came from September 1961 until August 1965. He returned again in September 1968 to replace another KGB officer.

KOSTIKOV is considered to be one of the most effective and dangerous of the intelligence officers in Mexico. He has had a wide range of responsibilities which have included operations among émigré groups in western Mexico, operations directed against the United States and currently against the governments of Central America. He presently meets with exiles from Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Honduras. He is known to have passed funds to these groups as well as tactical guidance.

57) **Valeriy Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV**: Works in the consular department.  
He goes out a lot at night and always alone. He travels often in the interior of the republic. He has "Mexican friends." He studied philology in the University of Moscow. He is very intelligent and clever in carrying out his work, which he does meticulously, taking every precaution. He apparently belongs to the KGB group. He was in Mexico as a bachelor more than 10 years ago.

**FROM**  
Acting Chief of Station, Mexico City  

**SUBJECT**  
[?Mariana?/??] Refers to Contact between Valery KOSTIKOV (291-35052)  
and Guatemalan Communist Party Representative in Mexico  

**ACTION REQUIRED**  
Action Required: None, FYI.  

**References:**  
A. HNMA-38419, 10 February 1970.  
B. MEXICO CITY 2303, 21 January 1970.  

1. On 10 February 1970, LIREBEL-2 provided details of his 6 February meeting with Jose Luis BALCACEL (Order 201-101-33), leader of the Guatemalan Communist Party (FZ). LIREBEL-2 reported that he arrived at BALCACEL's house about 200 hours on the 6th, and found BALCACEL about to leave. BALCACEL requested that LIREBEL-2 take him to a garage where his car was being repaired, which LIREBEL-2 did. Since BALCACEL's car was not ready, BALCACEL asked LIREBEL-2 to drive him to a meeting which he had scheduled for 2100 hours with his "Soviet contact." (Note: BALCACEL had previously told LIREBEL-2 that Valery KOSTIKOV was his contact in the Soviet Embassy.) LIREBEL-2 parked and BALCACEL held his meeting with his "Soviet contact" standing on the sidewalk of Come Paris Street bordering on the park. The meeting lasted for 30 minutes.  

2. BALCACEL commented after re-joining LIREBEL-2 that his "Soviet contact" had been very upset about a long distance telephone call which he had received from a Guatemalan student. The student had asked to talk to the Soviet by true name and asked him for some information on the Soviet national soccer team, which is scheduled to play some games in Guatemala. The Soviet told BALCACEL that he had told the student that he could not provide any current information on this subject, and that the student should try to get this information from El Salvador, where the team was to play some games prior to their arrival in Guatemala. BALCACEL said that the Soviet was angry that this student had asked for him by true name, and he speculated that the University Students Association (ASU) leader who was recently in Mexico (see Reference B) may have been indiscreet in giving his name out to unauthorized persons.

3. Addresses will recall this per Reference A, LIENOV reported that KOSTIKOV received a long distance call on 6 February in which the conversation conformed exactly to that described by BALCARCEL to LIHEZ-2 in paragraph 2 above.

4. It is of interest to note that KOSTIKOV is setting up clandestine contacts with Aleksandr PAVLOV (201-052639), leader of the Nicaraguan Communist Party exile organization in Mexico, and similarly with Jorge T. RIVERA Romero (201-051712), a Mexican Communist in Mexico. By virtue of these contacts, it appears that at least one of KOSTIKOV's responsibilities is maintaining contact with representatives of Central American Communist Parties in Mexico.

**SUBJECT:** Phone Call from ARAU Representative to Valery KOSTIKOV  

**ACTION REQUIRED:** [Home, FYI]  
**Reference:** MEXICO CITY 2303, 21 January 1970  

1. LINKOV reported that on 6 February 1970 Valery KOSTIKOV (201-305052), 2nd Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico, received a long-distance telephone call from Guatemala. The operator asked for KOSTIKOV by name; then told the caller "Mr. MONTESDEO." I have your call to Mexico ready; though KOSTIKOV came to the phone, the caller stated he was calling on behalf of the Guatemalan University Students Organization, but did not further identify himself. The caller and KOSTIKOV discussed the USSM national soccer team and its scheduled appearance in Guatemala. KOSTIKOV stated he was not certain exactly what date the team was scheduled to arrive in Guatemala, and suggested that the caller contact the soccer federation in El Salvador, where the team would be playing prior to its arrival in Guatemala. The caller also inquired whether there was any information on the ballet. (Reference) and was told that there was none.

> It should be noted that he primarily queries concerning the Soviet soccer team or the appearance of a Russian Ballet troupe would be handled by one of the Cultural or Press Affairs officers at the Embassy. KOSTIKOV's participation in these matters, as reported above, would seem to confirm previous stations reporting that KOSTIKOV handles dealings between the Soviet Embassy in Mexico and Guatemalan leftist organizations.

1. On 10 February 1970, LIKREZIL-2 provided the details of his 6 February meeting with Jose Luis BALCARCEL (201-160-30), leader of the Guatemalan Communist Party (CIP) exile organization in Mexico. LIKREZIL-2 reported that he arrived at BALCARCEL's home at 2100 hours on the 6th, and found BALCARCEL about to leave. BALCARCEL requested that LIKREZIL-2 take him to a garage where his car was being repaired, which LIKREZIL-2 did. Since BALCARCEL's car was not ready, BALCARCEL asked LIKREZIL-2 to drive him to a meeting which he had scheduled for 2100 hours with his 'Soviet contact.' (Note: BALCARCEL had previously told LIKREZIL-2 that Valery KOSHTIKOV was his contact in the Soviet Embassy.) LIKREZIL-2 and BALCARCEL drove to the 'Nuevo Escondido,' also known as the 'garaje hundido,' located on Insurgentes Star between Gomez Farias and Mitzt Streets. LIKREZIL-2 parked and BALCARCEL held the meeting with his 'Soviet contact' standing on the sidewalk of Gomez Farias Street bordering on the park. The meeting lasted for 0.5 hours.

2. BALCARCEL commented after re-joining LIKREZIL-2 that his 'Soviet contact' had been very upset about a long distance telephone call which he had received from a Guatemalan student. The student had asked to talk to the Soviet by true name and asked him for some information on the Soviet national soccer team, which is scheduled to play some games in Guatemala. The Soviet told BALCARCEL that he had told the student that he could not provide any current information on this subject, and that the student should try to get this information from El Salvador, where the team was to play some games prior to their arrival in Guatemala. BALCARCEL said that the Soviet was angry that this student had asked for his true name, and he speculated that the University Students Association (AEU) leader who was recently in Mexico (see Reference B) may have been indiscreet in giving his name out to unauthorized persons.

3. Addressees will recall that per reference A, LIZENOV reported that KOSTINOV received a long distance call on 6 February in which the conversation contrasted exactly to that described by BALACZEK to LIZENOV in paragraph 2 above.

4. It is of interest to note that past LIZENOV reporting has shown KOSTINOV setting up clandestine contacts with Alejandro RIZQUEZ Alegria (201-06628), leader of the Nicaraguan Communist Party exiled organization in Mexico, and similarly with Lorenzo ZRIAVA Romero (201-045172), a Honduran Communist in Mexico. By virtue of these contacts, it appears that at least one of KOSTINOV's responsibilities is maintaining contact with representatives of Central American Communist parties in Mexico.

## 1. Operations

Under this roof project, operations continue to be directed against the [MISSING TARGET] and, on occasions, bloc targets. Activities covered by the Project include providing information on [AGENTS], their activities, personalities, visitors, and contacts (LISACK-2, -4, -6, and LICOI-L); serving as access agents (LISPYP-1, -2, -3, LIROCKET-1, and BEZABER); [?]; assessing and occasionally recruiting access agents (LISACK-7); providing information on DEPT activities (DEPTAL-1) and DEBOX activities (BEZABER); and performing such other tasks as may be required on an ad hoc basis (LISACK-1 and all other aspects of the Project).

## 2. Administration

As assets take on a permanent character in terms of expenditure or other contracting administration, they are transferred from SB/OA to LISACK for ordinary handling. Beginning with this reporting period, and as outlined in the LISACK Project Renewal, BEZABER, DEPTAL, and LICOI-L were transferred from SB/OA to LISACK. Details of the functions, security, and meeting procedures are reported below for each asset.

## 3. Assets

a. **LICAVAE-1, -2, and -3:** The activities of these assets have been covered in detail in recent and continuing correspondence dealing with ALTAKOV. Please see ITEM-263164 of 5 November 1969.

b. **BEASNER:** During the reporting period, BEASNER was in Mexico City; students are in his hotel room at a pre-arranged hour using a telephone code to establish the location. On occasions, he is met at his house in Cuernavaca. BEASNER is currently targeted against Subject of 201-269115, with whom he has re-established a good social relationship. Through Subject of 201-276184, Chief of the Referrer, in addition to serving as an access agent to Subject of 201-268115, he has fulfilled explicit requirements such as providing information on Centro Intercultural de Documentación (CIDOC) and personalities of station interest. Although BEASNER has a fairly good social relationship with the REF DOXER C, his wife and has access to other DOXERS, he is having him concentrate his efforts on the higher priority MHHIRASHI, Subject of 201-269115.

c. **LICOLI-1:** We were not routinely once a month during the reporting period. Each meeting date is established at the preceding meetings and no further contact or confirmation is required. LICOLI-1 arrived by bus at a car pick-up point and is driven by the case officer to a small coffee shop where he reviews daily with the case officer. Due to the nature of his job and the level of his access, LICOLI-1 is not in a position to do more urgently than to report on the encounters he has with MHHIRASHI's who come into his universe. His reports normally consist of his assessment of personalities, information he has been able to pick up. LICOLI-1 also gives strictly reports of demonstrations and other unusual activity in the vicinity of the MHHIRASHI relationship.

d. **LIMEPTY-3:** LIMEPTY-3 is not at irregular intervals at various out-of-the-way restaurants for the purpose of debriefing on operational assignments and discussion of his written reports. Meetings are arranged by phone using OX code. His most recent assignment has been development assessment, and recruitment of 201-369011. LIMEPTY-3 has perfects the act of developing an operational level, but his target has required that he be used sparingly, selectively, and usually under alias. Development of 201-810981 has been his only assignment during the reporting period and LIMEPTY-3 made good early progress. Purporting to be the representative of a film club for architects, LIMEPTY-3 was able to get 201-810981 to agree to become a consultant. Thereafter, LIMEPTY-3 continued to ask questions about 201-810981's work, to the point where 201-810981 realized that more than a film club for architects was involved. At this point, it was decided to let LIMEPTY-3 break cover; recruit 201-810681 to supply information on the work of his office (but not--at this point--the people in his office), and continue to handle him until this point. He was firm and previous questions about the stability and reliability of 201-810931 had been resolved. This was done, and 201-810981 accepted recruitment, knowing that VOLODY intelligence was involved. LIMEPTY-3 led several meetings with 201-810631 after recruitment and counter-surveillance did not reveal any signs of MHHIRASHI surveillance. For about a month, however, LIMEPTY-3 has not been able to contact 201-810961, and it is possible that this later has developed cold feet. If LIMEPTY-3 can reestablish contact, he will continue to

### LIROCKT-1:

1) LIROCKT-1 is met monthly; time and place arranged 
   at the previous meeting. During these meetings he is debriefed
   on his twice-weekly teaching sessions at the LIHAINSI Embassy.
   His regular student has been the Subject of 201-028975, and he 
   has had occasional dealings with other MEMBERS, particularly
   ASSESSACK. The meetings with 201-020263 have not been of 
   particular interest, and we had been waiting impatiently for 
   the starter's replacement to arrive, so that LIROCKT-1 would 
   have a better target to work on. It was LIROCKT-1 who 
   came up with the first local confirmation of the identity of 
   this replacement (MEXICO CITY 1105, 2 August 1969). Dealings 
   with ASSESSACK have been concerned with attempts by the 
   director of the school where LIROCKT-1 teaches to show 
   sociological films from the MIAHNISI film office.

2) It now appears, however, that LIROCKT-1 has
   reached the end of the line. For some time he has been involved
   in a rather messy divorce action, and in August LIROCKT-1 
   reported that his wife had denounced him to Mexican authorities 
   as an ERVIK agent (a few months previously). He had denounced 
   him as an MIAHNISI agent. LIROCKT-1 was not inclined to take 
   his wife's ravings too seriously since he considered her slightly
   nuts. However, LIROCKT-1 reported that on 16 September 1969
   LIROCKT-1's wife called 201-028975 and told him to get him
   urgently on something of extreme interest about her husband,
   201-028975 told her to come to the Embassy, which she did,
   and she presumably repeated her accusation. Since that time,
   LIROCKT-1 has received a polite brush-off. He has been told
   that the LIHAINSI Embassy has run out of funds for English
   language training, and that there would be no more liaison
   unless 201-028975's replacement, or the new Ambassador (when
   and if one arrives), wanted to rehire him. He was told,
   however, to check in regularly, and he was given, as usual,
   an invitation to the annual LIHAIRSIA national (a) reception (he
   did not attend because he was ill). LIROCKT-1 has not spoken 
   with 201-028975 since his wife’s visit—all dealings have been
   through ATOLYLP, who has for some time been the paymaster for
   LIROCKT-1.

3) LIROCKT-1 was not aware of his wife’s visit, and 
   even after the case officer, without telling him that he knew
   of the visit, brought LIROCKT-1 around to the conclusion that
   she might have done this, he still does not think that she 
   spilled the beans to 201-028975. It is apparent that the
   MEMBERS, whether or not they believe LIROCKT-1’s story, have concluded that LIROCKT-1 represents a security hazard, and they are simply going to drop him. LIROCKT-1
   will continue to press the MIAHNISI for answers regarding 
   his future with them, and if, as suspected, they keep putting
   him off, he will be instructed to break contact (which will be 
   terminated by the Station).

4) Other than the blowing of LIROCKT-1 himself, little damage has been done. The wife has never seen the current case officer and knows none of the meeting arrangements or other 
   matters.

1. **DEPTAL:** She has been met weekly for a total of 13 times during the period. Meeting hours are prearranged and the location is always a safehouse. Her normal function has been to report on the activities at the DMT Ambassador, where she is employed as the secretary to the DMT Ambassador. In addition, she performed some casing and investigation in support of the AEATKOFF audio operation. Since the DMT target is of low priority, DEPTAL has been attempting to increase her usefulness to us by trying to obtain a job in the office of the President of the FTI, the ruling political party, with excellent prospects for success.

2. **LISACK-2:** Until he lost his job in September, he was the president administrator of the apartment building in which AEALGEL and AALMERS reside. Meetings were held bi-weekly for a total of four times, pre-arranged by telephone call several days in advance to his office in a publishing firm. Meeting location was a restaurant/cafe and meetings normally lasted about thirty minutes. He provided information on the activities of these two tenants and their families, license plate numbers, and descriptions of visitors.

3. **LISACK-4:** He is the portor of the apartment building in which Subject of 201-305870 resides. He maintains a daily log of the movements and activities of his other tenants, and he reports the license plates and descriptions of visitors to the building. He was not weekly for a total of 12 times, eating in a small restaurant within walking distance of the downtown office where he works all day. Meeting hours are pre-arranged to coincide with escape routes from the second job. He compensates for his lack of formal education by responsiveness to case officer direction, natural intelligence, and cooperation.

4. **LISACK-6:** He is the portor of the building in which Subjects of 201-837203 and 201-788681 (who took the apartment of Subject of 201-250304) reside. He maintains a daily log of these two MAINTAINERS, their families and visitors. He was met 12 times during the period. Since he cannot be absent from the building for over thirty minutes without arousing suspicion, meetings are always for a brief ten minutes and are held in a nearby park. As has been reported, the case officer who handles LISACK-6 became the target of unknown surveillance in August, and again in October, following meetings with LISACK-6. The Station believes that the surveillance was accidental, in that the meeting place was in a neighborhood frequented by male and female prostitutes and other undesirable characters. In any event, LISACK-6 has been put on ice, to be revived when the occupants of his building become higher priority targets.

5. **LISACK-7:** She was not met during the reporting period. She remains a "reserve asset" for special requirements in the real estate field for such potential uses as a farmhouse rental, key acquisitions and locating tenants when needed. Although there is no immediate requirement for her talents, we would like to maintain her operational approval so that she can be called on as a cleared asset when needed.

4. **Problems**
There are no problems connected with this Project.

# 5. Security

There are no known unresolved problems of security. The security problems relating to LIXOCTL-1 and LISACK (discussed above) are under control with no adverse effects noted.

## 6. Plans

a. There are several assets of the REDTOP section who have been carried under SD/COA for a fairly long period of time. Since the targets of their access change from time to time, as well as the nature of the information they provide, we do not believe they warrant special or new projects to cover them. We do believe, however, that they should be brought under a project to facilitate orderly reporting and administration without resorting to separate progress reports on each.

b. Since their activities closely parallel those of assets already covered by LISACK, we believe it would be logical to include LITOOL-1 and -2, LITOOL-1 and Subject 201-E43659 (on which we are awaiting an Operational Approval) in this Project. Although none of these is paid a salary, such a change will require some cost adjustment to the Project to account for minor operational expenses which have been charged to SD/OA. Separate correspondence will follow on these assets.

c. There are several additional assets currently in the developmental stage who may eventually be administered under LISACK. These assets include Subject of 201-37747 de dated 28 August 1969, targeted against AEOLYP; Subject of 201-351552, targeted against AEMERGE; Subject of 201-255963 and 201-290608 under Station direction; and Subject of 201-859225, who reports on his contacts with Subjects of 201-500548 and 201-744431, among other MIIHARSIs.

# UNIVERSAL GRÁFICO
**Viernes 17 de enero de 1969**

## Las "Instalaciones Diplomáticas" Rusas en Lima

Por CARLOS MONTIEL

Es un caso digno de ser redactado, presentado por una mafia internacional que está haciendo de México, donde se han instalado dos nacionales, una plataforma de exhibición diplomática considerada de nivel e importancia.

Seis años tras esas obras, a la espera de una pronta culminación, los rusos, que aparentemente, han tomado para sí la primacía con respecto a una institución muy importante, además de una representación diplomática terrestre.

En este contexto cabría mencionar las críticas de las autoridades chilenas en torno a las posibilidades que pueden ofrecer el buen desarrollo de lo que figura en el servil colectivo de "gobierno entre embajadas, consulates y lo que debe de ser una franquicia a ceder por los gobiernos en cara de negociar cualquier situación".

EL UNIVERSAL GRÁFICO se ha colocado en la defensa de las instalaciones diplomáticas rusas a favor de las mujeres de Vida. Destacando el reconocimiento a Yamé. El Kodé, que acabó en su segunda editorial, reseña una de las instituciones rusas burbujeantes de estas fechas.

# SECRET

TO: Deputy Assistant Secretary for Security  
Department of State  

FROM: Deputy Director for Plans  

SUBJECT: O KOSTIKOV, Valeri Vladimirovich  

1. Reference is made to your request dated 25 July 1969 concerning Subject.  

2. In a report dated 27 August 1962 from a reliable source, Subject was listed as a known or suspect KGD (Soviet Committee for State Security) officer. Although this report did not specify how Subject's position or possible position as an intelligence officer was determined, numerous additional reports have established that Subject is an officer in the KGB. Several of these reports are noted below.  

   a. A report dated 12 January 1962 from a reliable source indicated that Subject had a background which "emphatically" had strong ties to Soviet intelligence service (RIS) connections (i.e., a graduate of the Foreign Language Institute and/or the Institute of Foreign Affairs in Moscow). Subject was described as "possibly RIS" as early as 1959 when he attended an Electrochemical Congress held in Madrid, Spain, from 30 June to 10 July 1959. During this congress, Subject was frequently absent from the delegation, studiously avoided having his picture taken, and was generally noted for his "suspicious" behavior.

# SECRET

b. According to a report dated 16 March 1962  
   from a reliable source, Subject participated  
   in a Soviet effort to cultivate an American  
   Embassy employee.

c. A report dated October 1962 from a reliable  
   source indicated that Subject was believed  
   to be a KGB officer because of his position  
   in the Consular office where most of the  
   personnel were connected with the KGB.  
   Subject had been known to attend meetings  
   in place of other identified KGB officers.

1. According to a report dated 20 December  
   1963 from other reliable sources, Subject  
   KOSTIKOV had apparently taken over as the case officer  
   for one [illegible: appears to be approximately 2 words] LILU,  
   an agent of the Soviets who was formerly  
   identified by first name only. KOSTIKOV  
   was suspected by reliable sources to be the KGB  
   officer residing in Mexico City. Subject also had  
   considerable contact with Ivan Carviliovich.  
   
   KOSTIKOV was identified as one who frequently escorted diplomatic  
   couriers to and from the airport, a function primarily of the  
   consular section officers and, as far as was known, strictly  
   KGB responsibility. This same report identified  
   all of Subject's close friends as KGB officers.

2. In a report dated 14 May 1965, a reliable source, in an  
   attempt to analyze the KGB residence in Mexico City, Mexico,  
   opined that Subject was probably a KGB officer.

3. According to reports dated 22 December and 27 June  
   1967 from reliable sources, when Subject came to Mexico he  
   replaced a suspect KGB officer. When he left Mexico, he was  
   replaced by an identified KGB officer.

4. For further information concerning Subject, you are  
   referred to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

# Embajada rusa en México tiene un gran personal que trabaja poco

Por Carlos Montell,  
desde México.  

> En esta carta llegada a la redacción, periodistas informaron seres del artículo "El Hombre Pérdido" que en el mes próximo viajará a la primera emisión importante, y es la representación diplomática soviética.
>
> En este artículo comentamos que ministros de la Embajada muestran en la ciudad, han asegurado en no correr, la situación de vocación, un eco menos de esta embajada.  
>
> Según se informan en cálida época, para los días de abril, confirmando una noticia pasó en el titular de EL UNIVERSAL GRÁFICO, que otorgan a la administración de diplomáticos rusos a este electorado que se observará con los embajadores y energías de legado de las naciones extranjeras.

Recuerdo que también en  
  
- EL UNIVERSAL GRÁFICO, el colega Alfonso Tranga C. publicó en las últimas ediciones Diplomáticas, que la dirección bajista de la Xupete de Vladimir Retoruzhsk. 
- Y Yastik Botolito, evidentemente, de la embajada rusa en México, espera hacerse recibir a las familias que traían en furia.

> "Lo extraño era que la Finalidad de la URSS se envolvía de las que erguían un personal más superior, y un menor número de dependencias estéticas solicitando todo con el político . . ."
> 
> La situación cultural, y, como toda propaganda. "Yo que no discuto . . ."

- "Aquí que se decide, que embajada de preservamos . . ."  
> "No se trata de la experiencia alabada . . ."

"¿Y de quiénes que son?", reprendió a un punto.  
"Es la defensa sobre los hombres integrados, pues así . . ."

# SOVIET EMBASSY IN MEXICO HAS LARGE STAFF WHICH DOES LITTLE WORK

by Carlos Fontiel

Source: La Prensa Libre (Free Press), 6 May 1969, San Jose, Costa Rica

Mexico City -- In a letter addressed to our editorial department Peruvian newsmen informed me that, being acquainted with my article "Ahora Peru" [How Peru], they asked that country's chancellor, Edgardo Jarrín, whether the arrival of a Soviet trade mission in Peru would be only the prelude to another more important mission, that of Soviet diplomatic representation. 

In that article I observed that members of the Soviet embassy in Mexico City had predicted in that city's social circles that in less than 2 weeks Peru would establish diplomatic relations with the Kremlin at the embassy level.

According to the letter, barely 3 days later the Lima daily La Prensa confirmed with prominent play the report that I had made in El Universal Gráfico whose substance I had obtained thanks to the indiscretion of Soviet diplomats included in the "cocktail" circuit organized here among the ambassadors and trade representatives of foreign countries.

I recall that also in El Universal Gráfico my colleague,  
Alonso Fonseca G., published a note entitled "Alegres Diplomáticos"  
[Tipsy Diplomats] recounting the entertaining story of the “bing”  
of Vladislav Koromovshkin and Valery Kostikov, attache and second  
secretary respectively of the Soviet embassy in Mexico. These  
officials began their spree "between glasses of expensive wines  
in the 'red' district of Mexico City but had to bring their  
adventure to a close at Ciudad Victoria amidst the abuse they  
hurled at Mexico under the diplomatic immunity which they enjoyed."  
Apparently, the Soviet diplomats not only have given up decent beha  

but are also demonstrating their incompetence.  
  
The Peruvian chancellor, Mercado Jarrín, who announced the   
arrival of the Soviet trade mission, answered the newsmen's question  
with a laconic comment that "at the appropriate time you will learn  
whether the government has decided to take that step" [of establishing  
diplomatic relations with the USSR]. Before the Lima government  
“decides to take that step," we would like to reproduce these two  
paragraphs which the journalist Bernard Escalante published in an  
article entitled "La Embajada Misteriosa" [The Mysterious Embassy]  
in the newspaper El Sol de México.  

"The strange thing is that the Soviet embassy is one of  
those with the largest staff but with the least to do. Those  
branches that have contact with the public – consular section,  
cultural section, tourist agency – work only 4 hours a week. One  
can count the number of Mexicans applying for a Russian visa on the  
fingers of one hand. Trade between Mexico and the USSR is practically  
nil. The 'cultural relations,' as everyone knows, consist simply

```
in making propaganda 'from one place to another' inasmuch as  
in the land of Brezhnev and Kosygin they do not even have a  
remote idea of what Mexico is like.  

"What is this plethora of Soviet personnel used for  
then in that embassy where not even a single Mexican citizen is  
employed, where the domestics themselves are Soviet, in that  
huge mansion that could serve as a den of vampires? The mystery  
deepens if one considers that the Mexican embassy staff in Moscow  
barely numbers six or seven employees whereas the USSR has more  
than a hundred in Mexico. Why does the Soviet Union have such a  
large embassy staff in our country if it does what ours does in  
Moscow?"

**SECRET**

To: Chief, SB Division  
To: Chief, WH Division  
From: Chief of Station, Mexico City  
Date: 14 February 1969  
Reference: HUMA-3561

1. On 1 April 1969 the Station received a memorandum from local LNRGO concerning the latest meeting AKBURBLE had with his Soviet Case Officers. This memorandum is forwarded under separate cover as Attachment #1. The meeting took place in Mexico City on 3 and 4 February 1969. The Soviet case officers were Aleksandr Alekandrovich NIKITIN (201-484917) and Valeriy Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV (201-305052).

2. On 8 April 1969 we answered LNRGO's memorandum with comments concerning NIKITIN's and KOSTIKOV's whereabouts on 3 and 4 February 1969, the possible meeting place on 4 February 1969, and the cars used. Recent photographs of NIKITIN and KOSTIKOV were forwarded to local LNRGO also. This Station memorandum is forwarded under separate cover as Attachment #2.

> It is interesting to note that the 1969 Volkswagen with Mexico City plates '81 IW', assigned to Stanislav Vasilievich SCHEV (201-329083), was used as the vehicle to drive AKBURBLE to the meeting site on 4 February 1969. The use of SCHEV's vehicle, which is one of two Soviet vehicles which do not have diplomatic license plates, strengthens our suspicion that SYCHLY is a KGB officer.

# Valeri V. Lencikov

I have met him but I do not know his Lich.

Valentin Longanov, in charge of consular affairs, his wife Alexandra has been an amazing skating star, very nice, speaks very good Spanish, and fair English. Their daughter Kira, sixteen years old, very sophisticated, came here for a holiday. The only child of this age we have ever seen here. They have another child, who is in Moscow; both have been at our house for a party. In general, Soviet people come alone, leaving the wives behind.

Dmitri Pygov, wife Tatsila, have an eight child born here, he has been writing a book on the Mexican revolution. They are good friends. He was introduced to me by Boris Kazantsev who invited me for lunch for the occasion. Then we go to the Soviet embassy both he and Techarinov are always very attentive.

I know several other people from the Soviet embassy but really I couldn’t place them together with their names.

## Alegres Diplomáticos

Por ALONSO FONSECA G.

Querido Lecto, desde la diversidad alzada de la época, una entre burbujas de silencios, entre borrosas y hasta convencionales cartas de la antigua ciudad de México, yo como el editor de este diario, quiero dedicar este espacio a una singular y verdad que otra más traviesa, a lo que su nombre sea.

Los despedadores de la embajada del país vecino, esta vez representados por el embajador Koltunovich y Vidiáx, demostraron bien su oficio, no sólo dirigiendo aquí su mirada hacia los tres hombres destacados en la cumbre de la luna, que en peligro, en habilidad provocaban permanentes desembarcos por los mutantes.

Al llegar a Ciudad Victoria, los ingenieros de PEMEX entregaron a las autoridades necesarias los regales nuevos y palacios. Por el exceso de fiscalização, que afligen a todos los planteamientos activos, todavía lograran la infinitud, excepto en respeto a la inmunidad diplomática. Contemos pronto la verdadera historia de cómo el gobierno de Mao Tse Tung ha aparecido, no seguro de cómo quedara.

Enector que disiere y reconoce actuar, considerándose un transgresor, al lugar donde nacen dos sin quantum que no circunscriba la vida de cada en Rusia.

# TIPSY DIPLOMATS
by Alonso Fonseca G.

Source: Not identified

This is the amusing story of a "spree" which began in the frosty dawn of 12 December among bubbles of expensive wines in the "red light" district of Mexico City and reached its conclusion very far off, at Ciudad Victoria. What are involved are two Marxist-Leninists from the Soviet Union who, on breaking the chains of disgraceful tyranny weighing on respectable diplomats, "tanked up" in bourgeois bars, not in order to cheer up and forget some sorrowful episode or other that gnawed at their hearts but rather to fire a broadside of abuse and insults at Mexico and Mexicans under the pretext that when one is "tipsy" everything that he does is absolved.

The diplomats of the Russian embassy in Mexico, Valery Kostikov, second secretary, and Vladislav Koromovshkin, attache, not only forgot among hippies the socialist ethics in order to indulge in a "small drink among those who are in the limelight"
```

[Page 82]

```markdown
but, in the midst of a big "binge" made possible by hateful capitalist brandy and whiskey, they decided to accompany four engineers of PEMEX [Petroleos Mexicanos; Mexican Petroleum] in an old automobile to Ciudad Mante. On the way, after the customary excesses that alcoholic fumes provoke, the "wine" drove the Russians to the worst extremes of crudeness, without any of the "academic bearing" that the Friendship University of Moscow notes as the major assets acquired by the progressive men of Leninsim. Accordingly, abuse rained on the Mexicans.

>The four PEMEX engineers, as any well-born sons would have done, defended their country with firmness. Thereupon, the Russians suddenly became transformed into diplomat-gunners, brandishing their weapons at the engineers. However, no doubt because Russians are better at getting ready to handle remote-controlled spaceships directed at the moon than in the skillful discharge of prosaic pistols, they found themselves disarmed in short order by the Mexicans.

>On reaching Ciudad Victoria the PEMEX engineers handed the Russian attaches and their guns over to the local authorities. Despite the unanimous desire of all those present to see the Soviet representatives get their comeuppance the latter, with insuliir arrogancce, insisted that their diplomatic immunity be respected.

>Let us compare the aggressive stance of both Muscovites with the Chinese government of Mao Tse-tung so insist...

## SECRET

**C/1, GH Division**

**Chief: A.B., COS, Managua, COS, Panama City**

**Chief of Station, Mexico City**

**[REDACTED] MEXICO**

**Soviet Contact with Alejandro BERMUDEZ Alegría. (291-Q6269)**

---

1. The Station believes that Alejandro BERMUDEZ Alegría, Nicaraguan Communist living in exile in Mexico and known to have been the link between Moscow and the Nicaraguan Communist Party in regard to sending Nicaraguans to both [C/S?] school and Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, is identical with the identified KGB officer Valery Vladimirovich KOSTYROV (201-30552) as well as with the identified Modesto RIVAS, originally brought to have been a Panamanian, who in 1956 was reported in contact with KOSTYROV and then with his successor, Vladimir Sergeyevich KOROSTILEV (201-74321), who is also an identified KGB officer. It is noted that Alejandro BERMUDEZ Alegría used the alias Modesto RIVAS for receiving mail at his post office box letter drop. 

2. Following the chronology of the LDB/NY reporting on "Modesto's" contact with the Soviets. As will be seen, it appears that the combination "Modesto BERMUDEZ" was a conclusion jumped to by LIVNOV and was in fact probably cover given as such. The references to "Panamanians" could be a cover for "Nicaraguans."

3. On 1 Jun 1956 "Modesto RIVAS" called at the Soviet Embassy for KOSTYROV and arranged to meet him at four o'clock "in the same place."

# Document Title

## Text from the Document

- On 29 Jun 1955 "Krestyanka" called KOSTIKOV to say he could not be mistaken for the radio and made to take a late evening train. Krestyanka said earlier that KOSTIKOV was waiting in his office for an appointment at the Moscow station that day, when KOSTIKOV said he would stop by later around 2 p.m.

---

- On 6 Jul 1955 "Mendeleev" called KOSTIKOV and asked if there was anything that KOSTIKOV knew about his people traveling to Kishinev. KOSTIKOV said he had asked his people to see what he had done. KOSTIKOV also noted that Lepinov had received any news from the doctor, and Mendeleev said, even though he had sent a telegram, Mendeleev said he would keep a copy of the telegram to send to KOSTIKOV.

---

- On 7 Jul 1955 "Mendeleev" told KOSTIKOV that, after he talked to him the day before, he had received a cable asking the same question, i.e., what was going to happen. KOSTIKOV wanted to know what to answer. KOSTIKOV said that they would have to write about those who must be received cable to prepare for an answer. Mendeleev said he could answer for them. KOSTIKOV said he would prefer to put a cable and asked that he could be in his office in the afternoon, if KOSTIKOV wanted to reach him.

---

- On 8 Jul 1965 a man identified by voice as the above mentioned was told at the Soviet embassy for the Vice Consul (i.e. KOSTIKOV), he was told to call back, and when asked who was calling, it was said he was calling on behalf of the Russian (it appears to be approximately 15 words/characters).

---

- On 9 Jul 1965 a man called at the Soviet Embassy for KOSTIKOV, and said, "Tell him that Mendeleev said to leave a message for him." KOSTIKOV said that if KOSTIKOV was not there, the caller's name was "Mendeleev Hristov."

---

- On 9 Jul 1965 a man left a message at the Soviet Embassy for KOSTIKOV saying that Mendeleev had called. This came out in letters as his name from Mendeleev himself, a reference, but this was probably the messenger's way of identifying the same kind of the above conversation and not what the man actually said.

---

## Special Notes

- On 12 Jul 1955 Mendeleev again spoke to KOSTIKOV (and is again described in detail by Mendeleev as Mendeleev PARSHINOV). Mendeleev informed KOSTIKOV that the job from PARSHINOV ("the dispatch to Kuznetsk") had arrived. KOSTIKOV suggested sending Mendeleev at the same place and asked if he, Mendeleev was to justify. Mendeleev said, as it is true, and KOSTIKOV said the same must be returned back no later than that time. Mendeleev also asked about the "anchor matter," yet KOSTIKOV still had no news.

---

- On 14 Jul 1955 it was again reported that "Mendeleev" called. Mendeleev called and sent a message to bank Mendeleev that he had called. Again, the Mendeleev has stated that Mendeleev "Parashotin" was probably a KOSTIKOV assumption, stating that Mendeleev actually said.

---

- On 1 Aug 1965 Mendeleev called KOSTIKOV, (again, probably the Mendeleev assistant), and said he would ask if KOSTIKOV wanted to call him on another number (the record of a sound call).

---

- On 12 Aug 1965 MURRY reported that "Mendeleev," Mendeleev called KOSTIKOV and asked whether the arrangements had been dispatched.

# CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH  
**SECRET**  HME-23295

1. On 22 Sep 1965 LITVINOV reported that "Modesto BERMUDEZ, panama" called from inside the Soviet embassy at 1128 hours to a local travel agency (i.n./Frybound) and spoke with a man LALASTIDA, asking him about the price of the ticket to Paris under the same system they had used to send the other people. LALASTIDA asked for one of the names in order to pull the card to see how it had been done, and LITVINOV gave him various possible variants and said that he would call back in the afternoon for some specific information. (LITVINOV traces show that Guillermo AGUIRRE Rodriguez, 201-24571, is a Nicaraguan who was at the CPT school in Moscow in 1965). (LIMITE reported that the man in the attached photograph, who is undoubtedly identical with Alejandro ARIAS Aguero, visited the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City from 1111 to 1147 hours. There seems no question that he is the "modesto BERMUDEZ, panama" who has been reported by LITVINOV in all the above conversations.)

2. On 29 Sep 1965 LITVINOV reported that "Modesto BERMUDEZ, panama" called KURSKIY and said he had some things ("zencaproc") for the MOLOSKIN said he would see Kostas at seven o'clock in the usual place.

# DISPATCH

## SECRET

To: Chief of Station, Panama City   612 P  
From: Chief, WH: Chief, SR  
Chief of Station, Mexico City  

**Subject:** REDOCAT - Modesto BERMUDEZ  
**Action Required:** [?Action required?]  
Reference: PACY - 7321, 8 July 1965  

1. Panama City traces are requested on Modesto BERMUDEZ, a Panamanian currently in Mexico City. BERMUDEZ has been in touch with Valery Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV (201-305052), Vice Consul at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City and identified KGB officer.  

2. On 7 July 1965 "Modesto" called KOSTIKOV, saying that he had just received a cable asking about the trip to Helsinki, to which "Modesto" wanted to cable a reply. KOSTIKOV said that they had to wait a day or two, but that he would send an urgent cable. On 8 July 1965 an individual identified by voice as the "Modesto" above called KOSTIKOV, who was out, and left the message to tell him that he had a call "from the Panamanians." On 9 July "Modesto BERMUDEZ," a Panamanian, left a message for KOSTIKOV to call him. (Source: LIENOVY.)  

3. It appears that the conversations above refer to the Panamanian delegation to the World Peace Congress being held in Helsinki 10-17 July 1965. BERMUDEZ is not, however, one of the referenced six Panamanians who arrived in Mexico on 6 July on their way to the Congress.

### 13. INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY (positions, functions, agents, contacts, other details, including how you learned about each item, etc. in chronological order, including narrative summary where necessary; such as D/A cases, incidents, etc.)

About March 1963, Subject and CARMAH (see Soviet Contacts) flew from Mexico City to Tijuana, Baja California, where they rented a Hertz car allegedly for recreational visit. The car returned to Mexicali and Ensenada and departed for Mexico City on 13 March 1963. (35) (36)

On 1 September 1963, Subject VALIEKTEV (see Soviet contacts) flew from Mexico City to Tijuana where they rented a liter auto. While renting the auto, Subject was asked for identification. Subject stated he was an employee of the Mexican government at Exñeriter Relating. Later, when pressed for identification, Subject stated he was an employee of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. Subject and ALFREY spent most of their time in the company of Jask Carlos Chukup (see western contacts). The Soviets visited Listere Beach, Punta Banda and Maura SYANOVITCH's curio shop (see western contacts). 

On 7 September 1964, they witnessed the Sabala used for dinner at a floor shown in the company of Jiguiel POFFE (see western contacts). On 10 September 1964 the Soviets purchased 20,000 bales of cotton to be shipped to Esnanda, final destination unknown. Subject and ALFREY were also in contact with Deninter ALAHUR (see western contacts), who was allegedly authorized by the Soviets to find three Mexican youths to travel and study in the USSR. The two Soviets departed Tijuana on 13 September 1963.

> On 19 January 1964, when LICOOY/S (A Station double agent) returned to his apartment building, SIUHIB (see Soviet Contacts) and Subject were seated in a car outside and NECHILPONK (LICOOY/S's case officer) was about to ring the doorbell. NECHILPONK told LICOOY/S that RIZIKOV (the former KGB case officer) was in town and wanted to see LICOOY/S. NECHILPONK also gave LICOOY/S tickets for the Soviet Soccer game on 19 January 1964. (38)

(COMMENT: LICOOY/S is being handled by NECHILPONK and is a KGB agent. This is the only known occasion of Subject being involved with LICOOY/S in anything but an overt business contact.)

Subject met with AEUBURLE in Mexico City on 9-11 and 12- February 1963 and received information from AEUBURLE on industrial and missile sites in New York City. Subject also gave AEUBURLE requirements of the same nature to be carried out in the future. Subject made arrangements with AEUBURLE for his next meeting, to be held in New York City, with a different, unidentified Soviet. On 6 May 1963, AEUBURLE was met in accordance with the above arrangements by Oleg Danilovich BRIKYN (201-292588), a translator assigned to the U.S. Secretariat in New York City. BRIKYN has been identified by a sensitive reliable source as a member of the KGB's 11th Department. (31)

Substantiating information that Subject is a member of the KGB is derived from his connections with Martarito LNU (see Western contacts) undoubtedly an agent (unidentified) formerly in contact with the former First Secretary and KGB Resident Viktor Nikolayevich GLOTOV. (33)

Subject attempted to cultivate David T. PATON (see American contacts) an American Embassy officer formerly assigned to the Visa Section and who now has protocol functions (1965). This cultivation ceased, as far as is known to the Station, immediately after the Station (with Embassy approval) advised PATON to indicate to Subject his disinterest in socializing with him. (33)

> (COMMENT: A Ricardo LUI with a Central American or Cuban accent has been in contact with Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Lopez, Second Secretary and Intelligence Officer, Cuban Embassy, Mexico City.) 

On 11 March 1963, one Ricardo PEREZ (not further identified) attempted to call Subject and left a message that he would like to meet with Subject the "place Subject knows" on the next Friday.

> (COMMENT: Ricardo PEREZ may be identical with RICARDO LUI of the above paragraph because of the similar trend in conversation in arranging meetings. One Ricardo PEREZ called the Cuban Embassy on 26 June 1964 to tell Antonio GARCIA Lara, 201-325338, Commercial Attache and Intelligence Officer, Cuban Embassy, Mexico City, that he had a message for GARCIA from Margarita DALTON, Mexican citizen, student at University of Havana and sister of Raque DALTON, Cuban IS Agent.)

# Contact Report: Silvia McDaniel
**12 May 1965**  
**Subject:** Maria Cristina garden

1. Ceasotter, known as Don Jackson, and Martinez, introduced as Mori Bryan, met Subject on 12 May. Subject reported on her attendance at the WWII Victory celebration at the Soviet Embassy held on 9 May, and its aftermath on 11 May at the art gallery of Alfredo Santos.
   
2. Subject, who attended the reception alone, her invited friend Georgina did not go, attracted a small circle of companions during the evening. First, there was a Guatemalan, a professor at the National University, who made conversation, learned she was a singer, and spoke of having her appear at a concert in Puebla. Next, Vladimir Andreyev, his receiving line duties ended, joined her. Their conversation dealt with artists in Mexico, a pickup from the first time they had met at the Santos Gallery some two months ago. Then, Valeriy came by and seemed to be mostly interested in watching Subject. Subject took an instant dislike to Valeriy (probably Kostikov). A short, blond Russian then drifted into the group, whom Subject pegged as a parachutist. 

   Subject was just about able to include Andreyev in this invitation, and then Andreyev was come from the group. The invitation was for 11 May at 1100. During the evening Andreyev mentioned that he would like Subject to perform at the Soviet. Subject said she would, but made details for the engagement were missing. 

3. On 11 May, Andrew and Valeriy showed up at the Santos Gallery. Subject introduced them to Alfredo Santos. Andreyev seemed to be enchanted by the Gallery; Valeriy was less demonstrative. They had brought a bottle of vodka and passed a few hours in the company of Alfredo. Subject confirmed her distaste for Valeriy, and formed her impression of Andreyev that he wanted to break out of dull Soviet circles into the grayer, freer atmosphere of the artist set in Mexico. No specific appointment was made for Subject to see either of the two Sovs another time.

4. Subject is her concern to know where this operation was taking her and the part she was to play in it, rang in some additional characters in her personal life. There was Georgina (Jim), her very good friend, salesclerk, claiming to Subject’s artist, student at U of A, who considered Andrew a "teaser." Subject considered that Andrew and Georgina might very well develop a relationship.

because she, Subject, though willing to pursue a platonic friendship with Andrew, would have none of the other, and it was not unlikely that German might captivate Andrew. There was Antonio Carras, Subject's current boyfriend, a bodyguard to Miss Order, who was giving evidence of growing serious about her. Subj was concerned that her participation in the operation might in some way cause harm to Antonio. Subject was certain that a host of artist friends at her home expressed concern that she if she were followed and spied upon, a misleading impression might be gained.

5. Other personal matters about Subject that came out in the conversation were that she has income from stocks (sufficient to maintain her in Mexico), she in a distant artist's status, would like to attain integrated because she has difficulties with the Russian Union (ADA) that hampers pursuit of her profession; she is not interested in marriage; she opposed to bypassing the limitations on her work imposed by her status. 

6. The C.O.'s, in their guidance to Subject, made it clear that she could pull out of the operation any time she wanted, that it was in her power to barnstake it either with her or with the Story, if she got involved with them. She told that there was absolutely no harm that could befall her boyfriend, Antonio, from her continued participation. As for Georgina, the chips would have to fall as they may with Andrew, since Subject was Georgia's confidante, we would be appreciative of knowing about Andrew's involvement in any affairs. She wanted to know why we were interested in Andrew, and the C.O.'s glad-handed her to the extent of telling her that it was our business to know about important Soviets, since one never knew when a Soviet might be in need of "help." Subject indicated she was willing to go along further at a slow pace.

7. In talking about the Soviet Victory reception, the presence there of L-1 (this picture had been in the News) came up. Subject said she knew L-1. She characterized L-1 as flighty. She said he didn't get along with his wife. She intimated that when L-1 was lonely, he chased after female companionship. L-1 drops by Subject's place every so often. She knew that L-1 had left his father's business and had gone in for crop-dusting (a relatively recent development).

* Arrangements were made that "Mort" would keep in touch with Subject about once a week by phone (Tel. 46-11-06, Calle Rio Navas 52) and later she would be given an emergency number to call.

1. Forwarded herewith is a characterization of Subject prepared by Douglas J. FEINGLASS. The SPR on Subject has been prepared and will be forwarded as soon as typed.

2. It is interesting to note that LICOWL-1 describes KOSTIKOV as follows:  
   He is a man who would do anything to anybody. He is without morals, education or manners. He uses foul language and has no respect for others. When KOSTIKOV drinks at his (LICOWL-1's) establishment, with Soviet women present, KOSTIKOV will run his hand over the legs of the wives of other Soviet employees, while their husbands are present, and think nothing of it. According to LICOWL-1, the husbands say nothing when KOSTIKOV does this. (Comment: However, from a recent LICOWL-1 tape, it appears that Yurly Aleksandrovich ANDRIANOV, GRU chauffeur, was complaining to Viktor Petrovich KALININ, administrative employee, that his wife was running around with KOSTIKOV and he (ANDRIANOV) was going to say something to KOSTIKOV - someday - but had not said a word to him as yet.)

# Valeriy Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV

Valeriy Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV is approximately 35 years of age, corpulent and paunchy, with a round somewhat fleshy face that sports a 5 o'clock shadow, and wears oversized tinted glasses in dark heavy frames, which partially obscure a pair of small, but piercing eyes. His heavy jowls, thin lips, wide nostrils and dark hair add to an impression that his features are more of a Semitic, or a Near-Eastern type than that of a Slav. A shapeless dark suit-coat, carelessly put over a white shirt, with unbuttoned collar, through which protrudes a tuft of dark hair completes a photograph of Valeriy Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV, Attaché of the Consular Office and identified member of the KGB.

KOSTIKOV arrived in Mexico in December 1961 and assumed his duties as an attaché at the USSR Consulate at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. Owing to his extrovert nature and propensity for drinking, he soon acquired several "buddies" of similar background and with similar tastes. Among these individuals, his closest associates have been, or still are, the following:

- Vitaliy Borislovich SHUBIN, Attaché and identified member of the KGB, who left for the USSR in July 1964;
- Ivan Gavrillovitch ALPERIEV, Pravda correspondent and KGB officer, who left for the USSR in October 1964;
- Oleg Maksimovich NECHTORENKO, Vice-Consul and identified member of the KGB, who is still in Mexico, and who has accepted KOSTIKOV into his circle of intimate friends.

---

[Page 152]

```markdown
However, it was mostly with SHUBIN and ALPERIYEV that KOSTIKOV felt entirely at ease. Many a time KOSTIKOV would talk to either one of them on the phone and indulge in a friendly exchange of obscenities, whereas he has never spoken to NECHIPORENKO in a like manner, even though KOSTIKOV has been a frequent guest at NECHIPORENKO's house. KOSTIKOV developed an exceedingly close relationship with SHUBIN. They used to travel together to various parts of the country and to spend time together with their families at the Casino de la Selva, a hotel in Cuernavaca. But it was ALFERIYEV's wife Roza, who became the prime target of KOSTIKOV's attentions. An embittered acrimonious woman, Roza, who despised her husband and had a fierce hatred for NECHIPORENKO, was transformed into a different human being when KOSTIKOV talked to her on the phone in his best uncouth and ingratiating manner. It is impossible to say whether they had sexual relations, but the obvious and strong sexual overtones in Roza's voice led one to presume that she had more than just a friendly interest in KOSTIKOV, who on the other hand, was probably using Roza as a target for his amorous or illicit aspirations.

It seems that KOSTIKOV is quite preoccupied with matters of sex and if given an opportunity would turn into a veritable profligate. Apparently his
```

[Page 153]

```markdown
wIfe Roza has a tolerant attitude towards KOSTIKOV's probable incursions into the domain of marital infidelity. Since, on one occasion, when KOSTIKOV had been invited to a supposed stag party at ALFERIYEV's home, and Roza KOSTIKOV had phoned to caution KOSTIKOV against drinking too much, a woman answered the call and then called KOSTIKOV to the phone. When Roza talked to KOSTIKOV it sounded that she was more peeved at the fact that she had not been invited to the party rather than that other women were present there at the time.

When KOSTIKOV started talking to his wife on this particular call, he already had had a few drinks and in disguised voice spoke to her in Spanish, French and English, possibly to impress those who were present. His Spanish is quite good and fluent, his French is rather tolerable, but his English is somewhat stilted and of a school-room type. Possibly, he studied these languages at the Moscow Institute of Languages.

This fluency in Spanish affords KOSTIKOV a great latitude for making friends among Mexicans and his easy-going earthy approach is presumably of considerable help to him in developing contacts. Since his consular duties are quite negligible, he can easily engage in this sort of activity. In fact, this neglect of official duties prompted a heated argument between NECHIPORENKO and the visiting Soviet correspondent Timur GAYDAR.

who declared that: ostensibly the consular staff does not perform any useful function, but just loafs around. His assertion has been confirmed in part by the attitude of this particular group of Soviet Embassy employees, who quite often seek some diversion of a non-intellectual type. Thus, on one occasion, when a group of Soviet tourists had a brief stay in Mexico, one of them - a woman, complained during a phone call to the Embassy that KOSTIKOV and Leonid Vasilyevich NIKIFOROV, tourist representative in Mexico, had taken the group leaders to NIKIFOROV's apartment in order to have a few drinks, leaving the rest of the tourists without any information about their next move and letting them shift for themselves.

Since the departure of SHUBIN and ALFERIYEV, KOSTIKOV has started to "cultivate" NIKIFOROV, presumably as a potential drinking companion, and has been talking to him on the phone a number of times recently in quite a familiar tone of voice. It seems that NIKIFOROV, a younger man, is being influenced by KOSTIKOV to a certain degree.

KOSTIKOV's family life does not appear to be a stormy one; because his wife Roza A. sounds easy-going and friendly. She is in charge of the Embassy's dining-room. Her co-workers treat her with a good-humored tolerance and a slight contempt. KOSTIKOV's daughter Svetlana, born in 1959, seems to be an average child, who does not present any outstanding problems to her parents.

# To summarize KOSTIKOV's character traits and abilities

KOSTIKOV is well trusted to take trips around the country in the company of another Soviet Embassy employee on various matters of importance and, on occasions, he acts as an interpreter for visiting Soviet officials. His known physical defect is weak eyes. Sometime ago KOSTIKOV called up an eye-specialist for an appointment, because his eyes were troubling him and that is probably the reason for his wearing tinted glasses. Sometimes Mexicans refer to him as the man with glasses. It is quite possible that an auto accident KOSTIKOV had in Vera cruz may have been caused by his somewhat defective vision and was not the result of carelessness. However, when KOSTIKOV was excusing himself for it, GARAMSHEV, to whom he spoke on the phone, told him dryly that it was about time KOSTIKOV learned to drive.

Owing to this shortcoming of having weak eyes and his physical make-up, KOSTIKOV does not participate in various indoor or outdoor sports as much as do other members of the Soviet Embassy. It seems that billiards are about the most strenuous exercise that he undertakes. However, it must not be surmised that he is a weak individual in a physical sense and will probably give a good account of himself if a situation will demand it. Many of his intimate collaborators call him "Kopcheny" or "Smoked."

which in Russian slang may mean an individual with a dark skin, or may refer to the fact of his wearing tinted glasses, or it may signify that he went through a school of hard knocks

It is quite certain that KOSTIKOV and ALPERYIEV belong to the same group of former hooligans, who by dint of sheer disregard for moral standards forged ahead and became "somebodies".

KOSTIKOV seems to be quite unscrupulous, ready to perform any sort of task set before him, not in a cold and methodical way, but with a certain zest and bravado. It appears that he has no moral, religious, or any other type of scruples. He is vulgar, untidy, and lecherous, with a penchant for using lewd and obscene expressions in conversation with his "buddies", with whom he drinks quite a lot, circumstances permitting. In addition, it must be noted that he is a shrewd and resourceful individual unquestionably loyal to the Communist system.

**RE: KGB/VLADIMIR KOSTIKOV (201-305052)**

---

### I. 
We have recently reviewed available information on Valery Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV, a consular attaché at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. *It appears quite possible that KOSTIKOV may be a member of the Thirteenth Department of the KGB’s First Chief Directorate, as will be seen below.*

1. KOSTIKOV has been positively identified as the Soviet who met ABRINOV in Mexico City on 9, 11 and 12 February 1963. (Mexico City Station identified KOSTIKOV as the only Soviet in Mexico who fits the description, and subsequently ABRINOV identified him from a photo spread.) KOSTIKOV received information from ABRINOV on industrial and missile sites in PDPRIME and gave him requirements of the same nature for the future. KOSTIKOV had made arrangements with ABRINOV for the next meeting, as both were to be in New York City with a different, unidentified Soviet. On 6 May 1963 ABRINOV was not in accordance with the above arrangements.

   - Oleg Danilovich ABRINOV
   - Secretary: A.  [illegible: appears to be approximately 18 words/characters]

   > By a sensitive, reliable source, it is believed KGB's Headquarters Department passed Berlin astronomical charts and given additional requirements particularly relating to the bases of missile transpirators during the later meetings.  

   KOSTIKOV wished to change the nature of the same and, at least, he told ABRINOV that he wished to represent the same KGB.

# DISPATCH

**S-E-C-R-E-T**  
**RMV-13305**  

1. It has been reliably reported that at present the KGB's Thirteenth Department plays the greatest emphasis on its sabotage mission. Sabotage targets include the most important strategic military and industrial facilities of Western countries. The requirements assigned to ABZURBLE by both KOSTIKOV and BRYKHIN correspond to this mission.

2. In view of the obvious ODYOKE interest in any activities of the Thirteenth Department, we urge that you prepare an analysis of KOSTIKOV's activities and contacts in Mexico.
