**AMBASSADOR PERSONA ATTACKED BY SIGNS**  
**FRB No. 85, 30 Apr 64**  

Mexico City Correspondents: Dispatch in Spanish to PESSA LATINA Havana 1210 GMT 30 April 1964. [FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY]  

(Excerpt) Mexico City - in an article in the Mexico City magazine SIEPES on 23 April, Walter Ruiz states that the U.S. Ambassador, Patrick E. McGowan, responded to the news about Cuba and Brazil. "It's a sad situation," he stated, "when we have to witness a public outcry in person against the Cuban national in which we are interested." It is true, as they say, that ambassadors are constantly interning in our executive affairs as if it were the most natural thing. They feel as if they were on common ground, do not look like ambassadors than personnel who are no consideration or position to anybody, as if this country belonged to them and they enjoyed boundless privileges.

> This is no great cause for surprise. U.S. ambassadors are constantly interning in our executive affairs as if it were the most natural thing. They feel as if they were on common ground, do not look like ambassadors than personnel who are no consideration or position to anybody, as if this country belonged to them and they enjoyed boundless privileges.

> The surprising thing is that nobody has protested the insult. In Mexico, has been passed over in absolute silence. Worse than this, it is obviously more so. He seems dead in his briefs, little than Mr. Eyreson's arrival. But to talk about anything but policy, because, at least, it is independent policy, e.g. the North Union in the Johnson-Man(?)-Lain(??) relation to the prevailing violence; a foreign intelligence (illegible: appears to be 1-2 words) which has to ensure policy of international campaigns that require the security of a bull in the pursuit.

> Further on the letter read, "Either the salon run(?) is wrapped short of nobody. The response has amped out. That is it, in particular, though, had raised his voice to teach him dominion, and that is the secretary of state, going over the bill, and I am? about. He could have said, 'honor that bill seriously,' and it is about. Drawing point out, this is independent countries; that encompasses the work.

But for Fulton Wyeman(?), it seems it’s?(?) Julian(?)-looking, raising his voice so nobody can be mistaken. He knows it hard right? (illegible: appears to be 2-3 words) the start, and sums it, stating he is not going to try to convince anybody but will give orders. This indicates quite clearly that the State Department thinks it has been top patient and the circumstances are ripe for acting tough and violently.

# "A sus Órdenes, Jefazo-Pagés"
## Por LEON GUZMAN

### Nuevo Sirviente Oficial: Rico, Galán y con Libre

El señor Victor Rico Galán, escritor de "Siempre", trata de cumplir su libertad haciendo de sirviente clínico al gobierno y a su revista "mister" el regente del comisionado. Bueno que este "mamarracho" trate de salir y que abjure a quien lo le da la razón trotkista; bueno que utilice la comprobada vía de ese esfuerzo de "siempre" para labrarse su salida, bueno que use a los remos imperialistas y a tropas intestinas de todas las culpas, encontrándose de tal y muy presente -capta del gobierno- y de la clave dominante mexicana. Bueno para sus muy mezquinos y pequeños "objetivos" pues sus derechos palabreros nada tienen que ver con la lucha.

![Description of what the image shows](image)
* The image includes a drawing depicting various individuals involved in labor and rights struggles. In the foreground, a worker is depicted engaging with a symbolic representation of labor rights, likely conveying the message of ongoing struggles against oppression.

Victor Rico Galán, otro ser humano político de calaña, es enervado y aberrantemente traidor.

Desde la revista "Siempre", vociferando desde el columna, Rico Galán escribe ahora su "leal papel" y el gobierno.

De la parte, y ahora que el gobierno conviene, he abusado de estar en esta revista primera mental, siendo envado por la clientela partidiaria que sustentaba de una supuesta "legitimidad" y defiende en toda su aras al gobierno, al presidente en turno y a la clase obrera.

#### [Page 1]

[Page 25]

```
# Encuentro

Desde "siempre" he encontrado, desde el "terror" y la más drástica del servilismo, a todos los grandes atributos de algunos de sus escritores. Cara a cara con estos he visto.

"Siempre" he estudiado de forma activa y apoyo activo a los dueños del poder, mucho papel, muchas decisiones. Divulgar una fortuna para entender que es una ventana; para procurar una orden dignificada, y se puede; los "bandidos" de este mundo pueden ser heroicos, en actitudes y orden.

## Propagación Oficial

Toda la propaganda oficial tiene que hacer solo un solo mismo: descifrar. No puede ser un avance banal. El temido, el sombrero, le deja huella. Libera su "emprendimiento," idólatra, de expresión.

*"Filósofos" como ellos representan un "artículo" o "discípulo" a quien. Hago cada vez más, "Siempre" se pueden cambiar los criterios.

### Educación y Principios

Esto puede cambiar de criterio cuando estoy equivocado. Por ello, el hombre que hubiere "huido," se interpondrá, y no ha pasado. Esto, en la condición del que "perturba" el camino.

> Se debe decir "artículo" al requisito de la revolución y la estructura. 

Escribo como se escribe verdaderamente en: "De un nuevo ser." 

Nada a la izquierda, nada a la derecha. 

El mismo orden, de la correspondencia, se convierte en el superior y el inferior, que hacen lo que debe hacer. 

### Reflexiones Necesarias

Los jóvenes que se abrazan a un "grito," y por fortuna, bajo el título un poético Galán, solo por su "profesión" de un escritor. Al final, nada se puede hacer sin libertad, al mismo tiempo, hemos logrado ser familiares.

### Conclusiones

Como la revista "Siempre" es un acto democrático, se refiere la resolución y la instrucción en su esencia primera.

# Document Title

De la solidaridad revolucionaria, y de la limosna inútilmente otorgada por manos compulsivas que buscan una aparente tranquilidad independiente, se han de hablar grandes temas que deben quedarse claras. Una importancia particular debe ser dada al enorme blaques hasta el juego por el derecho de hacer la policía por informática.

## Inscripciones

1. **Género**:  
   - Vázquez
  
2. **Historia de al revés**:  
   - Rodríguez, desterrado por el gobierno en La Habana, Cuba.

Pero, podemos, los que allí estamos de Simper Galán, nos tomamos el deber de dudar.

> Escribir me regocija en esta razón, siempre que me ondo aquí, y me tomaron mi voz en un momento que puede afirmar que el responsable del asesinato de Pablo Alvarado es, no, está porque así lo dicen muchos académicos que tienen la posibilidad de mirar lo que el presidente de la República americana.

Así para finalizar, quiero dejar claro que si pueden compartir en misás, si no lo pueden refutar.

- **Testigos**:
  - La D.C.I. han de seguir siendo parte de la esperanza.

> Además, se les debe denunciar y dar a conocer este procedimiento, pues es un hecho que están condenados, y yo, sólo un simple testigo, les doy la razón.

### SWL PART III: INVESTIGATIVE SUPPLEMENT -- SOURCE SHEET  

**Summary Instructions for SWL Form Part III: Investigative Supplement**  

1. Enter only data in items 11-20 suitable for release to other U.S. or foreign security and intelligence services, since this form supplements SWL Part I (items 1-10) with those items of identification data considered of particular value to professional security and intelligence agencies in identifying and locating the SWL individual concerned and in developing reporting sources on him: See Section III, para 5, of Instructions for detailed guidance on completing items 11-20.

2. A precise record must be maintained and recorded below of source and documentation data for the information entries. The column Entry No. should correspond with the item numbers. Hence, when source and document are the same for information entered under two or more items, the pertinent item numbers may appear together under the Entry No. column with source and documentation data recorded only once.

3. When the completed Investigative Supplement is to be passed to another agency, the white page containing items 11-20 may be redacted in the required number of copies. The sensitive blue Source Sheet must not be reproduced.

    The original of this completed form together with the Source Sheet must be permanently retained inside the left cover of the 20-dossier.

### Instructions for SWL. Firm Part IV. Operational Data

1. This form will be used for maintaining a ready reference list of sources with direct or indirect access to subject and for recording operationally sensitive data on subject's subversive activities.

2. Data incorporated into this form are operationally sensitive and are intended to aid the field station responsible for investigative follow-up of an individual, in directing questions and leads promptly to other components with sources in a position to acquire data, or to components best able to evaluate new information.

3. In entering data on sources with direct or indirect access to subject, specify the cryptonym of source [either agent or liaison service]. If a liaison service is involved, specify component, officer (by cryptonym), and, if possible, agent sub-source. If other than a professional source is involved, specify location and date of information, nature of contact as well as identity. E.g., “Family contact: Juan MORELOS, Mexico City, May 1964.”

4. The information entries of operationally sensitive data on subversive activities must be sourced by reference and include cryptonym, to facilitate rapid referral of questions to the responsible desk or field station. Where an entry under this section deals with contact with an intelligence or security service, first give service designation and name of the officer or known agent with whom contact has been recorded. Then specify succinctly the nature of the relationship or activity involved.

5. The completed form, or a copy thereof, should be affixed to and retained in the left cover of the 201 dossier.

Rico had an interview in late October '63 with David Turner (leader of the Vanguard of National Action [VANA], radical pro-Cuban revolutionary group in Panama), 'Helms' (pro-Cuban deputy to the National Assembly), and Hugo Victor (president of the People's Party, Pro-Communist) discussing an armed movement in Panama.

### B-2
An Armando Conte, "a writer for Tiempo in Mexico," reported to have come to Panama and talked to Hugo Victor around 5 Nov '63. He said he had come to convince Victor of the need to support the Cuban armed revolution. Victor told Conte that the PUP would not be told what to do "because it had its own line on the Panamanian revolution." [context: appears to be a quote or citation]. 

Field comment: travel records contain no information on the arrival of any person with the name Armando Conte during the period in question and this name is believed to be a pseudonym used by RICO.

Reports have identified Rico as an agent of Fidel Castro who in May '63 was assigned by Castro to visit Central and South American countries to consult with leading Communists in order to initiate programs of anti-US violence and subversion. He reportedly arrived in Santo Domingo by air on 8 Jan 64 from Kingston, Jamaica.

A-31. 10 Feb 65 Merida

Visited Merida (had been there 28 Oct 64) and it is quite certain that there will shortly appear an article in a Mérida (Mexican leftist weekly) more articles on the nascent situation. It can be expected that Rico Calan will attempt to attribute all or a large portion of Yucatán's troubles to the "imperialist" US.

"Rico went to Merida during the first few days of February to make a personal investigation of the situation caused by the decrease in the price of jengibre." Rico wrote "Yucatan: Our leader is *jengibre* in Issue #10, 3 Mar 65, of *Sicmero*."

Re Dominican Republic: "Rico, writing in the ultra-left *diario de Mexico* favored Bosch's return, originally wishing his *poco* live, and later, after the apparent failure of pro-Bosch forces, complained that 'the reactionaries always win out in Latin American coups, being supported by the US or else the coup fails.'"

Veteran anti-trusted pro member, prolific reporter of reliable information, described Rico as "member of the Peoples Electoral Front (PEF) and National Liberation Movement (Jano Pino) was one of three leaders who met in March or April 65 to draw up a letter of conversation to the National Congress on Liberty of the Political Parties and the repeal of the Law of Social Dissolution."

Planning to investigate the "disappearance of Victor Manuel Guitierrez" in Carbine, Guatemalan Communist Party (PCG) leader of the Guatemalan exile community in Mexico, who returned to Guatemala in late February. Source claimed "Rico could only enter Guatemala illegally; it was not cleared [?passport?] and granted by the Guatemalan Government." In 1953 after he visited the country on holiday, President Peralta, this year, he also managed to talk with Victor Anaton. Upon his return to Mexico, Rico wrote articles "Sargopale" to the rebels and most unfaltering to the Peralta government.

and the writer, Elena Garro de Rio, the latter states: "the Cuban Embassy had severely chided Rico for writing an article favorable to the guerrilla leaders who were killed recently during their assault on the army barracks at Madera, Chihuahua. Rico had been close to "Che" Guevara rather than Castro, and that since Guevara's disappearance, he had grown noticeably cooler toward Cuba. She added that although he is a Marxist and is anti-American, Rico "is also very hostile to the Mexican Communist Party [PCM].

"10-13 August, Rico argued with 5 others; the PPS is pleased and will do nothing to help them. According to Carlos Sanchez, Caranda, of the PPS National Executive Directors, it is almost impossible to believe that a man like Rico could be the leader of an armed rebel movement. He has always been considered a Marxist intellectual belonging to no party who has confined his battles to the pages of magazines like "Life," "Cine Sincero," and such. Luisito Toledo frankly thought of him as incapable of doing anything that involved a mass following."

## Summary

1. Victor RICO Galan is a prominent pro-Castro Marxist journalist associated with Poliitica, a pro-Communist bi-weekly news magazine, and Sinpera, a Mexico City Tofit news weekly. In 1961, he was reported to be a member of the Periodistas Mexicanos Amigos de Cuba and the Committee for Solidarity with the Cuban Revolution. As of June 1965, he was reported to be a member of the Frente Electoral del Pueblo (PEP). He was a founder of the Movimiento de Liberacion Nacional (MLN) of which he was the head of the National Press and Propaganda Committee as of 1962. RICO acted as a Cuban agent in trips to Central and South America in late 1963 and early 1964. His pro-Castro communist writings as well as his contacts with known Soviet and Bloc intelligence personnel in Mexico during the past few years strongly suggest a propaganda role under journalistic cover on behalf of their interests.

2. Little is known of RICO's early life or education beyond what is listed in his basic biographic data. There is a possibility that he was active in communist affairs in Costa Rica and El Salvador in the period 1946-1948 and in Colombia in 1949-1950.

3. RICO Galan's prominence in Mexican leftist circles has been primarily intellectual. In an article in Sinpera in March 1963, he advocated the foundation of a new political party reflecting the true political tendencies of the 1910 revolution. This was necessary, RICO noted, because the MLN was an inert political organization rather than a political party, whose membership covered political spectrum from the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) to the Partido Comunista de Mexico (PCM), and was therefore diluted in effectiveness. A new party would represent a "third position": socialism in internal affairs and independence of Mexico in international affairs. With such a political action, RICO, the ALN would develop naturally into a broad national movement such as the FRAP in Chile.

4. Victor RICO Galan is an ardent supporter of Fidel CASTRO and is reported to be a close friend of his. In order to gather material for a biography of CASTRO, RICO, later joined by his wife, visited Cuba in October 1962 for about two months. He visited Cuba again during part of May and most of June 1963 when he spent eight days with CASTRO's closest aides, ostensibly to discuss his recent trip to the Soviet Union and his links with Khrushchev. On this visit the Cuban government gave RICO a mission to travel through Central and South America to contact local communists and guerrilla leaders and persuade them to begin immediate campaigns of violent terror in order to take pressure off the PALM in Venezuela. RICO was also charged to bring about greater unity among the various leftist groups.

5. In the Fall and Winter of 1963 and late 1964 undertook this mission. Even though a known leftist he possibly had some arrangement with the Mexican Government which may have gotten him special privileges and support from Mexican embassies in countries where he visited. In Guatemala RICO interviewed General Enrique PERALTA Azurdia the Chief of Government and then met Raul ALARCO Monastario, military training leader of the Partido Guatemalteco de Trabajo (PGT), who took him to meet and interview Marco Antonio YON Sosa an Anti-regime guerrilla leader; RICO possibly also met (fn) GOMEZ Ayala also a guerrilla leader. In Nicaragua he also met with Alvacas RAMIREZ González, Secretary General of the Movimiento Revolucionario (MR) and a member of the Central Committee of the Nicaraguan Socialist Party (PSN). In Costa Rica he met with one of the MORA brothers, a guerrilla leader. In Panama he met Hugo VICTOR, president of the Partido del Pueblo (PPP), and David TURNER, leader of the Vanguard of National Action (VAN), and attempted to reconcile them in their dispute for leadership of the revolution in Panama; he also urged an immediate program of sabotage and violence. RICO went on to Venezuela to meet Arguela LAYA; he was probably in contact with the MIT while there. He then went to Brazil where he contacted Paulo SCHILLING, coordinator of the Popular Mobilization Front. During this time he may have gone to Cuba briefly and returned directly to Brazil. After a few days back in Mexico RICO went to the Dominican Republic who attempted unsuccessfully to obtain photographs that Dominican guerrillas killed the month before, probably to use them for propaganda purposes. As a result of his contact with the Agrupacion Politica Catroco Juan (APCJ) in the Dominican Republic he was able to show during the Dominican Republic crisis of May 1965 as a rallying point for material and instructions from Cuba to the APCJ and also as a reporting channel from Juan B. MEJIA and APCJ leaders to the Cuban Intelligence Service and the APCJ's CASTRO Cuban leadership in Cuba. After his return to Mexico City RICO visited Cuba again ostensibly to interview CASTRO on his more recent trip to the Soviet Union and probably to report on his mission.

6. RICO Galan continued his interest in the guerrilla struggle and was reported to have entered Guatemala clandestinely in August 1964 and possibly several times before than as well, so visit YON Sosa and his guerrillas. In March 1966, after having returned from Cuba the month before, he planned to travel again to Guatemala clandestinely in order to investigate the disappearance of Victor Manuel GUTIERREZ, leader of the PGT and of the Guatemalan exile community in Mexico, who had recently returned to Guatemala.

7. RICO's writings show an ardent support for the guerrillas in Latin America and for their method in achieving the revolution. In October 1964 the Guatemalan Armed Forces captured a number of tape recorders and tapes from the guerrillas including one by

Victor RICO Galan. This tape consisted mainly of an exhortation for unity between the PGD and the 13 November Group, and counseled against letting doctrines replace action. RICO’s talk to the guerrillas under DON BOAS reveals him as an intellectual radical with a pragmatic approach towards current situations. The text of the tape indicates that they were made between February and mid-October 1964. On 13 January 1966 El Heraldo, Mexico City newspaper published an article quoting RICO Galan’s taped speech as evidence of bias efforts to undermine the January 1966 visit of DIAZ Ordaz to Guatemala. The text of the tape was possibly passed to El Heraldo by the Mexican authorities in line with the Government’s campaign to neutralize all potential and existing opposition to the impending visit.

**Contacts:**

Mikaily LEONOV, Soviet Press Attaché and KGB officer, with whom RICO may have arranged a meeting in May 1965 with Dr. Emilio CORDERO, Dominican exile in Mexico City.

Jovan MIRIC, a Yugoslavian journalist in Mexico and possible contact officer with whom RICO, around the middle 1965, discussed the Dominican situation and OAS intervention in the Dominican Republic.

Branko MILIJANOVIC, an intelligence officer in the Yugoslavian Embassy in Panama who may have had contact with RICO; in July 1964, MILIJANOVIC told Thomas KING, a prominent Panamanian communist, that RICO wanted her to go to Mexico and Cuba and arrange a meeting between CASTRO emissaries and three left-wing Panamanian political figures Carlos Ivan ZUNGA, Pablín ECLERVERS, both members of the Panamanian Socialist Party (PSP), and Manuel SOLIS Palma, Panamanian Minister of Education.

Mirva do VAN RABEN, member of the Central Committee of the Trotskyite Partido Obrero Revolucionario (POR), with whom RICO had social contact in 1965.

Prof. Juan MASCARO Neves, a Spanish national who, with his wife Carmen GARCIA de MASCARO, was active in connection with affairs of the Cuban Consulate in Tampico before he was deported to Vonuozuola in May 1966 for violating Mexican Immigration Law; he was a key contact of Victor RICO Galan during a visit the latter made to Tampico and Ciudad Monte in April 1966.

## Addendum

### Basic Biographic Data

1. **Education:** Victor RICO Galan may have studied at the School of Philosophy and Letters at the Universidad Autónoma de México (UNAM). One report states that he may have studied philology at UNAM.

2. **Siblings:** In May 1966 his sister Ana Maria RICO Galan was reported married to Guillermo MENDIZABAL, a collaborator with Mexican Trotskyists. An August 1966 article in the Mexican newspaper Excélsior stated that Ana Maria RICO Galan used her ex-husband's name and called herself Carmen MENDIZABAL Lizard. Another report of August 1966 states that Carmen MENDIZABAL Lizard, Victor RICO Galan's sister, may have traveled frequently to Guatemala and have been the contact between the Partido Comunista de El Salvador (PCES) and the Partido Comunista de México (PCM).

3. **Travel:** A farewell party was given for RICO on 9 September 1961 but there is no record of where he traveled.

Rico had been close to "Che" Guevara rather than Castro, and that since Guevara's departure he had grown noticeably cooler toward Cuba." She added that although he is a Marxist and is anti-American, Rico is also very hostile to the Mexican Communist Party (PCM).

8/NP  
TDCS 314/10379-66 17 Aug 66: highly placed police official, reporting believed reliable  
"Sufficient legal evidence is available to prove that Rico, Raul Ucaldo, and others were a part of a conspiracy advocating, and teaching the overthrow of the Mexican government by violent means."

COMP/NP  
TDCS 314/10419-66 18 Aug 66: presumed B-2  
"12-13 August, Rico arrested with 40 others; the PPS is pleased and will do nothing to help them." According to Carlos Sanchez Cárdenas of the PPS National Executive Directorate, it is almost inexplicable to believe that a man like Rico could be the leader of an armed rebel movement. He had always been considered a Marxist intellectual belonging to a party who has confined his beliefs to the pages of magazines like Political Science, and has not done anything that involved a more following.

# DISPATCH

**SECRET**

To: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division  
From: Acting Chief of Station, Mexico City  
Subject: JMROD/Victor RICO Galan  

Reference: HMAA 31108, 17 January 1967

1. Referenced dispatch forwarded a memorandum written by Zeno B. LEHOLD regarding his meeting with Subject on 13 January 1967. LEHOLD used journalist cover in his meeting with RICO Galan.

   RICO Galan was released from prison on 2 April 1972. [illegible: appears to be approximately 13 words/characters] reported that on his release he and two other prisoners released with him held a conference for students during which he indicated that conditions for a violent [illegible: appears to be approximately 5 words/characters] in Mexico do not exist. Subject indicated he was going to establish a new political group known as the Socialist Front. On 9 March 1972 a newspaper article reported that the head of the Popular Socialist Party of Mexico confirmed that RICO Galan had renounced Trotskyism. Since his release from prison he has been very quiet and the Station has received no reporting on his whereabouts or activity other than a series of leftist articles he is writing for "Siempre" magazine.

## PRO-CPF MARXISTS SENTENCED FOR SUBVERSION

Paris AFP in English 0006 GMT 25 Jan 69 [FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY]

*Text*: Mexico City, Jan 25 (AFP)—Six pro-Chinese Marxists were jailed for 8 years each here today after being found guilty of trying to organize guerrilla-activities in Mexico. Nine others were given less severe sentences.

All 15, who were arrested in 1966 and charged with conspiracy and illegal possession of arms, were preparing to make guerrilla attacks in various places in the interior, according to the authorities.

Among those jailed for 8 years was Marxist theorist Victof Rico Galan, described in a government communique as “one of the most active men in the country.”

![Description of what the image shows](image)
*Image depicts a newspaper clipping with the headline "PRO-CPF MARXISTS SENTENCED FOR SUBVERSION" detailing the sentencing of pro-Chinese Marxists in Mexico. The text provides context regarding the arrests and sentencing, highlighting key individuals and the charges against them. The article includes specific names and mentions the involvement of government officials.*

## LAYANA PRENSA LATINA in Spanish 2105 GMT, 25 Jan 69 [FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY]

*Text*: Mexico City—Newspaper man and writer Victof Galan was sentenced today to 8 years in prison and a fine of 10,000 pesos. The district judge also sentenced Gilberto Balan Pecrera, Guianando de Hueves, Italia Rolando Perez, and doctors Miguel Cruz and Rolfo Martinez to similar terms. They were all arrested in 1966 and accused of subversive activities. Ana Maria Bleo Galan, sister of Victof, was sentenced to 6 months in jail and a fine of 6,000 pesos. Yesterday she was freed on a 10,000-peso bond.

### BRIEFS

**LOAN REQUEST**—Mexico City—Mexican Prime Minister Antonio Ortiz Mena has disclosed that Mexico is seeking a 500-million dollar loan from the World Bank for rural development, hydroelectric projects, federal highway building, and rural electrification schemes. The main projects were for a re-nationalization of exploiting resources and improving infrastructure to benefit tourism, as a source of revenue. (Mexico City MUSTERS SUSTAINS RUSTERS Buenos Aires 1756 GMT 2 Jan 69) [FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY]

**DEVELOPMENT**—Mexico City—Mexican industrialists are studying a plan to come to the aid of the Mexican farmers by contributing part of their profits to a rural development fund. The National Manufacturing Industries Chamber President Juan Carlos Garcia has proposed that they contribute 1 percent of their annual profits to the fund, which would enable the chamber’s annual general meeting on 23 January. Details will be worked out later. (Mexico City MUSTERS English RUSTERS Buenos Aires 1756 GMT 24 Jan 69) [FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY]

1. Ricardo W. VIRANDA Aizala (201-247-8979), Guatemalan Consul who received guerrilla training in Cuba prior to October 1962. VIRANDA has said that he is in contact with the subject since he was in Mexico in January or February 1962 on a trip. VIRANDA also "said" he had met subject before the subject was with Anais MIRIAM in Cuba (in February 1960). VIRANDA has said that the subject has been a close friend of Guatemalan Consul, leader Bernardo LUIS Meza (for reference, 201-261-9573). The subject first met in Mexico. (Source: captured documents). [illegible: appears to be approximately 25-30 words]

2. Hillius Jimenez Conquera (E-1179, 201-228-3862), Salvadorean Consul employed at the Imperante Madero to proof-read the Soviet Information Bulletin. Jimenez has been out of contact with the subject for some time. During his last communication in early September, Jimenez reminded subject to remain in contact in case he needed assistance (Source: LIFTA). 

3. Looes Mari X AVAIREZ Povadas (P-4115) is a Spanish Communist employed by the Soviet Press Office as an editor for their Bulletin. He seems to be very active with consulting in Mexico and also frequently contacts Tomas Guajil and Juan REJANO Porres (P-1027, 201-109953). It has been noted that he once led the pro-Soviet Party in Mexico but has also close ties to various refugee groups, particularly the Cubans and Czechs as well. Can be seen as the leading figure of the so-called "Communist Party," EXICO. REJANO is in direct daily contact with ALVAREZ-Povadas. His address elections noticed particularly, several times. [context: appears to be a technical term]

4. In view of ALVAREZ Povadas' apparent acting as a cut-out for subject, as described above, the following tries may also be connected with Subject. On 29 June 1967 "Tito" told ALVAREZ Povadas that there was a "letter" from "Boger" confirming that he has been since 22 June but "maps" had not been able to reach ALVAREZ-Povadas before. ALVAREZ Povadas said he would be better after returning home to "discuss." At the same time, it is interesting that "Max" might be Marisol SALAZAR GARCIA (201-182923), a Guatemalan Council notiting in Mexico. SALAZAR has been very quiet recently on 14 July 1967.

### INOA-33125

1. Since June 1965 until as recently as March 1967, 
   Subject has been reported receiving telephone calls from 
   "Carlos," a non-Mexican contact. Morally Subject said 
   "Carlos" simply agreed to meet, without mentioning the place. 
   Wife "Señor Jacob" has been described as a smaller contact, 
   during the earlier conversations. (Source: [ILLEGIBLE]). Although "Carlos" 
   has a name in respect of land, the [illegible: appears to be approximately 10 words/characters] suggests that he 
   might be connected with Carlos [ILLEGIBLE] (R.C. 1901, 201-76535). Guatemala Council is living in Mexico. 
   
   Although [ILLEGIBLE] has been very quiet since 1964, there 
   has been considerable discussion down on him, he is known to have 
   been used by the Soviet in the past and probably still works 
   with them. In 1959, when [ILLEGIBLE] was reportedly working at the 
   Guatemalan embassy. 

   [ILLEGIBLE] is also reported to be in contact with Mikoly Vasilievich 
   [ILLEGIBLE] through [ILLEGIBLE], subject [ILLEGIBLE] suspected 
   him, as well as others.

2. Subject: "Hava (Eva)" (P-11846), wife of Guatemalan Communist 
   [ILLEGIBLE], was reported to have met Subject in May 1965. 
   On 29 May 1965 Subject invited Hava to dinner, apparently at the 
   suggestion of Arriuguese SEMO Calvo, Mexican Deputy Subject. 
   Hava told [ILLEGIBLE] that she was interested in her contacts, 
   other embassies, and particularly asked her to put him in touch 
   with [ILLEGIBLE]. Hava was supposedly reported to have 
   discussed dinner on several occasions. (Source: [ILLEGIBLE]). 

   Hava however has given Subject conflicting details, as though 
   there could be [ILLEGIBLE]. 

3. Victor "RICO" claim (P-7354, 203-336474), Spanish-born 
   Mexican Communist journalist, agent of Cuban government known 
   to have been sent by the Cubans to task the Guatemalan 
   government in 1963, in private, since August 1966 for subversive 
   activities, allegedly directed against the Mexican government. 
   In [illegible: appears to be approximately 5 words/characters] frequent contact against Subject in 1965-66, they usually 
   simply arranged to see each other to discuss undisclosed 
   matters, and Subject apparently called RICO from pay phones, 
   rather than from his office. (Source: [ILLEGIBLE]). Subject has 
   apparently provided RICO with propaganda for some articles, and 
   both couples well have been RICO's guerrillas activities.

# DISPATCH

**CLASSIFICATION:** SECRET  
**TO:** Chief, TWD  
**FROM:** Chief of Station, Mexico City  
**DATE:** (JMRDO Operational/Transmittal of Letter for Rico Galan)

### ACTION REQUIRED: None; FYI  
### REFERENCE: HMM-15207, dated 30 January 1967

Upon receipt of the letter sent via the reference above, the Mexico City Station officers concerned discussed the best method of delivering the letter to Rico Galan so the approach would appear natural and also to be sure the letter would be received by him. They decided, finally, to have LIRIC-11 deliver the letter to Rico's wife with a short explanation of its background. Two weeks were spent in trying to locate Ines de Galan and the efforts were "fruitless." The Station then decided to have LIRIC-11 deliver the letter to Elona Garro, an old friend of Rico's. LIRIC-11 tried for a week and one half to find her at home with negative results. The Station then instructed him to leave the letter at her home with a request that it be passed to Rico. Attached is a copy of the covering letter LIRIC-11 left for Garro.

**SUBJECT: VICTOR RICO GALAN'S VIEWS ON THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT IN LATIN AMERICA AND FIDEL CASTRO**

**ACQ: 31 JANUARY 1967**  
**SOURCE: LEFTIST JOURNALIST WHO TALKED WITH VICTOR RICO GALAN IN THE LENCERRI PENITENTIARY IN MEXICO CITY. SOURCE IS A RELIABLE REPORTER.**

1. **[Uncertain text]** "VICTOR RICO GALAN, PRO-URBAN PROTECTOR, WAS ARRESTED ON 02 AUGUST 1966, TOGETHER WITH SOME FORTY OTHERS, AS PART OF A POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MPR). RICO GALAN WAS CHARGED WITH REBELLION, CONSPIRACY, AND ACCUMULATION OF ARMS. UNDER THESE CHARGES, HE IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR BAIL."

2. "RICO GALAN BELIEVES THAT VIOLENT REVOLUTIONARY TERRORISM IS INDISPENSABLE, SINCE THE PEACEFUL ROAD TO CHANGE IS SLOWED EXTENSIVELY. REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENTS ARE ON THE RISE EVERYWHERE IN LATIN AMERICA, ACCORDING TO RICO GALAN. IN HIS OPINION, THESE MOVEMENTS ARE MARKETED WITH IDEALISTIC TENDENCIES, AND ARMS JUST AS RESIST AS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNIST COMMITTEE."

RICO GALAN STATED THAT CASTRO HAS THE DOMINANT INFLUENCE IN THE LINE.

# S E C R E T / NO FOREIGN DISSEMINATION

REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENTS IN VENEZUELA, GUATEMALA, COLOMBIA, AND ALL OF CENTRAL AMERICA. THE SOVIETS HAVE DOMINANT INFLUENCE IN CHILE, ARGENTINA, AND MEXICO. IN MEXICO, HOWEVER, CASTRO AND MECOOL SEE EYE TO EYE, ACCORDING TO MEXI- CALI, AND HAVE PARALLEL POLICIES; BUT THE SOVIET UNION IS THE PRIMARY POWER PROMOTING THESE POLICIES.

3. GUATEMALA AND VENEZUELA ARE THE TWO COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENTS ARE THE MOST ADVANCED, IN FIDEL CASTRO'S OPINION. HE HAD THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS TO MAKE ON THE SITUATION IN THESE TWO COUNTRIES:

   A. GUATEMALA. IN GUATEMALA, UNLIKE VENEZUELA, THE COMMUNIST PARTY HAD NOT INITIATED THE ARMED STRUGGLE; THE TWO GROUPS INVOLVED IN THE ARMED STRUGGLE WERE THE 13 NOVEMBER GROUP LED BY VICENTE ANTONIO SISA AND THE REBEL ARMED FORCE (FAR) LED BY OSCAR MONTOYA. SINCE THE DEATH OF LUIZ ARMANDO ALVAREZ, THE 13 NOVEMBER GROUP HAS WEAKENED INFLUENCE, WHILE THE FAR HAS "CARTUCHES" INFLUENCE WITH TIES TO THE GUATEMALAN COMMUNIST PARTY (CGC), MANY MEMBERS OF THE PEOPLE ARE PEASANTS, AND THE MAJORITY OF THEM SYMPATHIZE WITH AND SUPPORT THE ARMED STRUGGLE.

   B. VENEZUELA. BOTH THE COMMUNIST PARTY AND THE MOVEMENT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY LEFT (MIR) LAUNCHED THE ARMED STRUGGLE, BUT BOTH HAVE NOW ABANDONED IT. BOTH MOVEMENTS CONTINUED THEIR EFFORTS MOSTLY TO THE CITIES AND ENGAGED MORELY IN TERRORIST ACTS. THESE

TACTICS DID NOT PROMOTE THE REVOLUTIONARY CAUSE AT ALL.  
THE ARMED STRUGGLE IS NOT DIRECTED BY THE ARMED FORCES OF  
NATIONAL LIBERATION (FLAN) LED BY DOUGLAS BRAVO AND WILL  
NOW SUCCEED. (HEADQUARTERS' COMMENT: RICO GALAN IS ECHOING  
THE LINE OF DOUGLAS BRAVO, LEADER OF THE DISIDENT FLAN.) IN  
ACCUSING THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF VENEZUELA (PCV) AND THE MIR  
OF ABANDONING THE "ARMED STRUGGLE." BOTH THE PCV AND THE MIR  
HAVE HAD, AND CONTINUE TO HAVE, RURAL GUERRILLA FORCES AS WELL  
AS URBAN TERRORIST UNITS. ALTHOUGH A SOFT-LINE FACTION OF THE  
MIR RESUMED VIOLENCE EARLY IN 1964, THE MORE MILITANT UNITS  
CONTINUED THIS POLICY, AFTER FISHING OUT THE SOFT-LINERS.)  
RICO GALAN BELIEVED NICARAGUA IS AN APPARENT DEMOCRATIC  
POLICE STATE, TIGHTLY HELD. HE BELIEVED THAT POPULAR MOVEMENTS IN MEXICO AND ELSEWHERE IN  
LATIN AMERICA WERE ON THE RISE. SINCE THERE WERE NO LEADERS LIKE CASTRO AROUND,  
RICO GALAN BELIEVED THAT THE LEADERS OF THESE POPULAR MOVEMENTS WOULD COME FROM THE  
WRITERS, THE INTELLECTUALS, AND THE LAWYERS.  

5. REGARDING FIDEL CASTRO, RICO GALAN SAYS THAT NO ONE KNOWS WHETHER CASTRO IS  
A COMMUNIST OR WHAT KIND OF COMMUNIST HE MIGHT BE. HE IS A GREAT REVOLUTIONARY  
LEADER AND A GREAT TACTICIAN, BUT HE CANNOT PLAY THE ROLE OF LIBERATOR OF LATIN  
AMERICA FOR HE IS TOO DETRIMENTAL TO THE SOVIET UNION AND THE SOVIET UNION CONTROLS  
HIM TIGHTLY. REGARDING CUBA-SOVIET CONFLICTS, RICO GALAN SAID THEY WERE MORE APPARENT

# 31 gennaio 1967

Egregio Dottori,

Sono il pubblicista italiano Luigi De Marchi che, ecco l'onore di una breve intervista con voi tra il 11 e il 13 gennaio. Se certo, l'argomento di riflessione è il 'cosa di nuovo per pubblicare la nostra conversazione'. Auguro, la presento la prova in buone notizie. La affido ad un amico "di confidenza" che si incaricherà di farcelo pervenire.

Sono tuttavia in viaggio e farò tutto il possibile per rivederla presto. Nel frattempo gradirei, nolenti volenti, leee consentano, avere una critica sul libro che le mandai, *LIES DEFEAT KILLS*, per una eventuale pubblicazione sul periodico romano *Orientamento Sociale*. Salvo inteso che le rimetteremo pertinenza l'osservazione sul libro.

Con i miei più distinti saluti,
```

# 31 January 1967

Dear Sir:

I am the Italian journalist Luigi De Marchi who had the honor of a brief interview with you on the 13th of January. I have tried, up to now, without success, to get together with you again to continue our conversation. I trust that this letter finds you in good health. I am entrusting it to a friend "de compagna" who will try to see to that it reaches you.

I am still traveling and I’ll do everything possible to see you again soon. Meanwhile, I would be very pleased if you would agree to write a review of the book I left with you, *Utile Despues Muertos*, for eventual publication in the Roman periodical, *CORRISPOPNZEZA SOCIALISTA*. Rest assured that you would be paid promptly the usual fee.

-with best regards,  
Luigi De Marchi

13 January 1967

## SUBJECT: Meeting with Victor RICO Galan

1. The writer had about a one-hour meeting with Victor RICO Galan at the Lacumetri penitentiary on 13 January 1967. The meeting was held at the central reception room with several armed guards present; my civilian escort also remained. "The generals were" and there were also some other civilians present from time to time (I think waiting to see other prisoners).

2. RICO Galan arrived at the meeting (at about the same time as I did). After an exchange of greetings and a warm handshake, I gave RICO Galan my "letter of introduction" (a copy is attached). He read it carefully and then told me how glad he was to see me. He inquired about his friend Carlo Coccioli; I replied simply that I had seen him in Rome before he left for Paris and he was fine. (At the end of the meeting, RICO Galan asked me to convey his greetings to Coccioli when I returned to Italy, and of course I said I would). I also explained to RICO Galan that I was in a difficult position to bring it in. I think the guards had refused to let me.

3. Because of my connection with Coccioli, a pro-Communist journalist and a friend of RICO Galan in Mexico for several years, I plus the name of my periodical, Corrisondenza Socialista, RICO Galan apparently assumed that I was (and accepted me as) a fellow Marxist. He expressed thoughts during the discussion and in answer to questions. A friendly rapport was immediately established between us.

4. I explained at the outset that I was on a tour of Latin America to study conditions and revolutionary movements. If he were agreeable, I said I also wished to write a piece on him for Corrispondenza Socialista. RICO Galan was very agreeable, I also said that if he wished to write for our periodical, we would pay him. He also found this idea agreeable but qualified his approval by saying he first wanted to take a look at the periodical to see its "line" and format.

5. My first substantive question was how he viewed the revolutionary situation in Latin America. I asked whether he thought "violent revolution" a necessary stage in the development of Latin America. He answered quickly and
```

## Page 2

Empatically that "violent revolution" throughout Latin America was "indispensable" because the peaceful road to necessary change was "blocked everywhere." He saw revolutionary movements on the rise everywhere in Latin America. I asked for the ideological nature and affiliations of these revolutionary movements. He replied that they are Marxist, but with liberal tendencies, not as rigid as the international communist revolutionary line.

1. I asked in which countries the revolutionary movements were most advanced. He named Guatemala and Venezuela. In a category by themselves, there the revolutions were certain to win powers. Then he gave me a general briefing on these two countries.

   a. **Guatemala.** In Guatemala, unlike Venezuela, the Communist Party had not initiated the armed struggle. The two groups involved in the armed struggle were the "13 November" group led by Marco Antonio Yon Sosa, and the "Fuerza Armada Rebelde (FAR)," led by Cesar Montes, now that Luis Augusto Turcios Lima is dead. The "13 November" group, he said, had Trotskyite influences; while the "FAR" was "Castrista/independent," and with ties to the Guatemalan CP but also having differences with the CP. The people in Guatemala are peasants and the majority sympathize and support the armed struggle.

   b. **Mexico.** RICO Galan described Mexico as an apparent democracy but "police state, tightly held." Here the "popular movements" are on the rise. In answer to my question as to who was leading these "popular" and revolutionary movements in Mexico and Latin America, RICO Galan replied that there were no leaders like Castro around, and the leaders would come from the writers, intellectuals, and lawyers.

## 8.

I asked RICO Galan for his appraisal and total evaluation of Fidel Castro Ruz. He said, first of all, if nobody knows. He is a Communist or what kind of a Communist he is. He is a great revolutionary leader and a great tactician, but he can not play the role of liberator of Latin America for he is too dependent upon Russia and Russia controls him tightly. I think RICO Galan meant to imply that Castro has become a tool of the Soviets. He said, Ernesto "Che" Guevara really wanted Cuba to break away from the Soviet chains, but Castro is not able to do this. As to the whereabouts of "Che", RICO Galan said that perhaps not even Fidel Castro knows where he is.

## 9.

Regarding Cuban-Soviet conflicts, RICO Galan said they are more apparent than real. Then I asked him to name countries of primary Cuban or Soviet influence. He said Castro has dominant influence within the revolutionary movements in Venezuela, Guatemala, all of Central America, and Colombia. The Soviets have dominant influence in Chile, Argentina, and Mexico. However, he added, in Mexico, Castro and Moscow see "eye to eye" and have parallel interests, but the primary power to push these policies is Russia.

## 10.

RICO Galan said Communist Chinese influence in Latin America is negligible.

## 11.

After about an hour, our meeting ended abruptly for a guard - this official of the prison director came to get RICO Galan; his lawyer was there to see him. I left him back for an extra minute and then we parted; reluctantly, with a warm handshake.

## 12.

The foregoing clearly reveals RICO Galan to be an unrepentant, fervent revolutionary. He believes, on the basis of what he said, that he is associated with a winning cause. He was high spirits and looked fine.

## 13.

I returned to the Lacumbér Penitentiary at about 5:15 P.M. It seems afternoon for another session with RICO Galan. The main door entrance was closed. I knocked and it was opened a little window. I asked to see the Director, and the guard said he was not there. I explained where I was and what I wanted; when he heard the name of RICO Galan, the guard said it was impossible to see him and closed the window. A moment later I knocked again. I asked the guard if he would deliver a message to RICO Galan from me. He said that he would not... it was impossible, only the Director could do that. The guard certainly did his duty.

Egregio Signore:

Mi permetta di introdurmi - Luigi De Marchi, italiano, scrittore per il periodico "Corrispondenza Socialista" di Roma.

In breve, sto facendo un giro d'orizzonte per l'America Latina. Un amico suo, o compagno di lavoro mio, Carlo Coccioli, cui vidi a Roma in dicembre, prima della sua partenza per Parigi e della sua posta per l'America Latina, mi accennò del Lei e mi pregò d'farle una visita. Ecco qui: Vorrò anche approfittare di questa visita per fare un cambio di punto di vista con Lei.

Pregò tenga la gentilezza di darmi un po' del suo tempo.

Rispettosamente,

La pregunta que en cuales países han avanzado los movimientos revolucionarios, surgió en primer término a Guatemala y Venezuela, ya que al las revoluciones ciertamente se han ido poder. Luego se hizo un resumen general de esos dos países.

- **a. Guatemala:** 
  - En Guatemala, a diferencia de Venezuela, el Partido Comunista no inició la lucha por los dos grupos involucrados en el levantamiento el 13 de febrero. 
    - Se dirigió a la "nueva jornada" ??[?título?]??, ¿un hecho importante de Guatemala? 
    - Dijo que el novato por ciento de la lección de Guatemala, son cargos, y que la mayoría simpática y se apoya la lucha comenzada.

- **b. Venezuela:**
  - Aforte del Partido Comunista con el HPM.
    - Indicaron la lucha armada, aunque hubo la descripción concreta del mes.
      - ??[?NUEVO?]??, recordando que los manifestantes consideraron sus hombres como penados. 
        - En forma de actos terroristas, las tácticas no fueron ideales para la política nacional establecida por la administración en este.

        - Así se fue ??[?el?]? ??[?bajo?]? de la lucha ardida, y que este gobierno natural...

  - El texto también hizo hincapié en que la lucha me convención, como hace poco estuvo entre Venezuela y un defensor de Quincas, quien hace poco escribió en Venezuela y entrevistó a los líderes del interés. ??[?NUEVO?]?? también describió...

7. 
- También hizo una descripción de México como un experimento democracia, siendo este bien un Estado político recientemente científico. 
  - Dijo que aquí se escribe una propuesta de como suelen dirigir estos significativos populares revolución como el tejido en América Latina. 
  - ??[?NUEVO?]??, los mismos surgirán entre los creadores, intelectuales y licenciosos.

# Addenda, 17 January 1967, at Headquarters

1. My offer to Rico Calan (para 4) to pay him for an article he might write for CORRESPONDENZA SOCIALISTA was made at the suggestion of LIENVET/72.

2. The only time Rico asked me not to quote him (in any article I might write) was after he had finished telling me that Castro was too dependent on the Russians (para 8). Of course, I agreed. Also, Rico qualified his comment that Castro was a great leader by saying Castro was unpredictable; he would say one thing one day and something different the next day.

3. Regarding the abrupt ending of the meeting after just one hour (para 10), I think it is probable that it came about through an order coming down from LITMAP/8.

4. General Comment: I was given a fairly rough time by the authorities at the Lecumberri penitentiary. Director told me in no uncertain terms that I could not bring a bottle of whiskey to Rico which I had in my ALTALITA bag. On my way to the main reception area where the interview was held, I had to go through several offices and guards. At one point, I was asked for my passport and left my passport at the hotel. When I showed them an Italian calling card instead, they were not at all satisfied but let me pass on to the next processing point. Then I was taken to a private cell for a body search. I also had to sign in and out, presumably like any other visitor to the penitentiary.

5. The above incidents, though unpleasant for me at the time, indicate that LITMAP/8 had not made the Lecumberri authorities aware of my true mission.

# Translation of Letter of Introduction to Rico Galia

12 January 1967

Dear Sir;

Permit me to introduce myself; Luigi De Marchi, an Italian writer for the periodical "CORRISPONDENZA" of Rome.

In brief, I am on a tour of Latin America. A friend of yours and a fellow journalist acquaintance of mine, Carlo Coccioli, whom I saw in Rome in December, before he left for Paris and I left for Latin America, mentioned your name to me and asked me to pay you a visit. Here I would also like to take advantage of this visit to have an exchange of views with you.

I beg you to have the kindness to give me a little of your time.

Respectfully,

Luigi De Marchi

## MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

**SUBJECT:** LEKHOLO'S Contacts with LISNOVOY/2 on Rico Galan case, Mexico City, 11-13 January 67  
**REFERENCE:** Mexico City 9890 (IN 75993), 11 Jan 67

1. Reference reported that the Mexico City Station put LISNOVOY/2 in telephone contact with the undersigned on 11 January. Following is a full account of my subsequent contacts with LISNOVOY on 12-13 January on the Rico Galan case. L/2 served as cut-out between the Station and LISNOVOY. I am arranging my interview with Rico Galan at the Leoburdi penitentiary on 13 January.

2. The evening of 11 January L/2 phoned me at my hotel, and asked to see me the next morning; he suggested having breakfast together at my hotel at 0830. He came on time and we spent about an hour together. He stated that his purpose was to find out for L/ISN/8 what my cover story and detailed plan were for the interview with Rico. At the outset, he wanted to know whether I was an American or Italian citizen. He must also have been curious about my exact relationship with the Agency, but did not probe at all, and of course I refrained from volunteering any info.

3. L/2 seemed satisfied with our cover as an Italian journalist on a tour of Latin America for the Roma political, CORRISONDENZA SOCIALISTA. He approved also of the idea of mentioning Carlo Cacciolli to Rico as a fellow journalist who had added him to Italy in December to pay Rico a visit during a forthcoming trip to Mexico. L/2 expressed the view, however, that it was rather unlikely that Rico would agree to see him. He said in Mexico prisoners in general, and especially Rico, were very suspicious and rarely wanted to see strangers in prison. He then gave me a briefing on

Rico which painted Rico as an extremely evil and clever character who did not possess one ounce of sincerity and who would never come being a Marxist revolutionary, stripped of his Marxist propaganda, whereas Rico was a nobody - and Rico did not want to be a nobody.

1. I told L/Z briefly of my successful experiences with a similar case in the Philippines. He commented that it was easier to be successful in the Philippines for the level of culture there perhaps is not as high as here.

We parted with the understanding that L/Z would phone us at the COS's office later that morning after his meeting with LITMPO/6; when he called, at about 11:00, L/Z said LITMPO/6 lifted the cover story and the plan but he wanted to increase the chances that Rico would see me through the follow-up maneuver. L/Z wanted to send Elena Garro to Paz (the name was who had brought out Rico's signed statement of his willingness to tell all in return for his freedom) to Rico carrying a calling card and an issue of my periodical; she would thus persuade Rico to see me.

> During a later phone conversation with L/Z I pointed out the risks involved in bringing Elena Garro into the operation. (The Station's position was definitely against her involvement.) Being wealthy, influential, unpredictable and uncontrollable, Elena Garro; I pointed out, would be a loose cannon in the operation. L/Z reported back to L/Z, who in turn raised our hand. L/Z then came up with the idea of my writing a letter of introduction for Rico and requesting an interview. I agreed to this scheme. Later that evening I received instructions from L/Z that at 11:00 the next morning I should go to the office of the Director of Legislative's preliminaries and request to see Rico. The previous day L/Z had stated that LITMPO/4 wanted to go over the "whole agenda" gift before. I went to see Rico, but plansapparently changed and I did not have any contact with LITMPO/5.

7. At the meeting with Rico I personally handed Rico the letter of introduction, and got it back from him after he had read it. In the middle of our interview Rico asked me why I had not handed it to him as I had planned; but the abrupt ending of the meeting provoked my getting it back. During the briefing of L/Z by the COS and

1. Se realizó un análisis que discute su concepto y una total 
   cualificación del mismo. Este aspecto es muy importante, 
   ya que refleja el papel que tiene el discurso social en 
   su conjunto y lo que es el modelo de desarrollo que se 
   quiere plantear. 

   - Gran Cuestionamiento: 
     - Se deben considerar los aspectos teóricos que 
       subyacen en los discursos.

2. En relación con los conflictos cubano-soviéticos, Rico 
   decía que esto presenta algunos aspectos que parece 
   no encajan con la influencia real sobre los países 
   subordinados. 

3. También dijo que la influencia chino-comunista en 
   América Latina es significativa. 

4. Después de reconsiderar una frase, muestra evidencia 
   importante que plantea un camino de la conexión del 
   trabajo abordado, en donde el director de la revista 
   veía la intervención como un camino de menor. 

5. Todo lo anterior revela claramente que Rico Valdés, 
   como se ha comentado, y refuerza repetidamente. De 
   acuerdo con lo que dijo, creo que sí se considera 
   una causa victoriosa.

   un dilema que muestra cómo lo que parece ser 
   lógico con la influencia de diferentes sectores, 
   puede llevar a una estrategia muy peculiar.

**MEMORANDUM FOR:** Chief, WH/COG  
**SUBJECT:** Possible Re-interview of Victor Rico Galan (201-336474)  
**REFERENCE:** Mexico City 9925 (IN 77986), 14 Jan 67  

1. Reference summarized the undersigned's first interview with Rico Galan at the Lecumberri penitentiary on 13 January. At that interview Rico apparently assumed and accepted that I was a fellow Marxist journalist, on a tour of Latin America for the Italian periodical, CORRISPONDENZA SOCIALISTA. He talked freely regarding revolutionary in general terms about revolutionary movements and leaders in Latin America, including the Cuba and Soviet roles.  

2. My attempt to have a second interview with Rico was not successful, due to circumstances beyond my and Rico's control. The question now is whether we should plan to go through with a second interview. The purpose would be to obtain further information on revolutionary movements and leaders. The requirements of the Mexican Government are satisfied with the first interview.  

3. One possibility might be for me to see Rico in about 10-12 days, ostensibly after a return trip to Mexico from Panama (or Guatemala or some other country). I could ascertain to Rico the names of one or two Communist leaders of the country visited who had briefer me; I could also reveal some other deception or slanted information; including names of Castroite leaders; then wait for, or elicit, Rico's comments and observations.

The approval of the Mexican Government (LITENPO/8) would again be necessary for such a follow-up interview.**

Some of the main concerns regarding the environment arise from the fact that Carbon is not able to decompose. This means that the naturally occurring Carbon does not break down and continue to cycle as seen in other chemical compounds.

> Scientists explain that as non-biodegradable materials increase, the effects on the environment also worsen, leading to various ecological consequences. This issue isn't just localized; rather, it encompasses various regions and affects diverse ecosystems.

- It is also important to consider the impact on wildlife and how Carbon accumulation alters habitats and natural processes.
- Carbon emissions are leading contributors to global warming and climate change, which prompts a response from both governmental and non-governmental organizations.

## Conclusion

Addressing the challenge of Carbon management is crucial for sustainable development and the protection of our planet. Further research and innovative approaches will be needed as communities adapt to these realities.

(considering the clarification)

It has been proposed that for the further improvement of production, certain measures should be taken. I shall focus on the primary considerations, along with a more thorough analysis.

1. **Key Findings**

   - The data suggests that there are significant gaps in the current process.
   - Stakeholder feedback has identified areas for enhancement.

2. **Recommendations**

   - Implement new strategies for efficiency.
   - Consider alternative approaches in resource management.

I recommend conducting a follow-up study to better understand the impact of these changes and ensure that all parties involved are well-informed.

# DISPATCH

## S E C R E T

To: Chief, NJ Division  
From: COS, Mexico City  
Date: 6 December 1966  
Subject: Victor RICO Galan

---

1. Attached for your information is a copy of a piece written and signed by: Victor RICO Galan (Attachment "A") which he gave to Elena Garro DE PAZ to pass to INPURE. She handed it to IDENTITY, who in turn gave it to Bernard A. Edgebrook. Attached also is a copy of the covering note written by Mrs. DE PAZ (Attachment "B") and rough translations of both pieces.

2. On 5 December, COS gave LITEMPO-3 a Photostatic copy of Attachment "A". LITEMPO-3 said that he too had received a copy of the piece which he had given to LITEMPO-4 who sent one of his officers to interview RICO. RICO readily admitted that the nature was that he and Mrs. DE PAZ had discussed the matter that Mrs. DE PAZ had typed out the copy and had signed it to. LITEMPO-3 said also that RICO Galan had said that he was eager to talk about "Zed" and LITEMPO-3 mentioned sensitive. LITEMPO-3 said that he had no objection to such an interview. 

3. In the opinion of LITEMPO-3 the RICO Galan statement is merely a maneuver by which RICO Galan hopes to get out of jail by providing to supply information and to oppose Fidel CASTRO.

4. On 5 December, LITEMPO-1 told COS that RICO Galan is "almost crazy" for several reasons: confinement of course; his fear that his "friends" are going to kill him or that the Mexican Government will "arrange" his death. And because he has learned that his wife, [illegible: appears to be approximately 3 words] is telephoning with Manuel MARQUEZ, Partinas editor of POLITICA.

(Translation)  

"6 November 1966, Mexico D.F.  
Having taken part in the serious discussions which arose between Fidel Castro and Che Guevara before the Dominican conflict on tactics, policies and agreements to follow in Latin America and which caused the disappearance of Che Guevara, I consider myself authorized to write a political testament to unmask Fidel Castro before the revolutionaries of Latin America as an agent of Stalinism.  
The fall of Cañizales, the murder of the Peruvian leader Uceda, the crisis of Turcios, etc., have been carried out by Castro agents, charged with the murder and destruction of everything that differs with Castro's line. (Rolf) Monjes (Rubacher), (Miguel) Cruz (Ruiz) and myself have been delivered up by agents such as (Luis) Lizardi, Esquendez, and others to silence the truth that should be known by the Latin Americans. The next victim is Fon Coes and many more who have hidden themselves for the moment from the assassins. My testimony would be political and ideological since I myself wrote many of Guevara's articles and it would omit nothing of names and details necessary to unmask Fidel Castro and his agents."

# Noviembre 6 de 1966 México D.F.

Hablando tomado parte en las graves discusiones surgidas entre Fidel Castro y
Che Guevara ante al conflicto de Santo Domingo, a propósito de las tácticas, líneas
y planes a seguir en América Latina y que ocasionaron la desaparición del Che Guevara
se consideró autoritario escribir un testimonio político que desenmascare a Fidel Castro
ante los revolucionarios de la América Latina como a un agente del estalinismo. La
desgracia de Camaño, el asesinato de Toda el líder peruano, el crimen de Turcios etc.
han sido ejecutados por serios contrarrevolucionarios, encargados de asesinar y destruir todo
aquí una difiera de la línea castrista: Heiner, Cram y yo mismo hemos sido entrenados
por agentes tales como Lázaro, Menéndez y otros, para callar una verdad que debe ser
conocida por los latinoamericanos: la próxima víctima es Ton Sosa y muchos más que en
estos momentos se encuentran en los(flagrantes). Mi intención sería político e ideológica
ya que yo tengo que escribir muchos de los artículos de Guevara, sin alcanzar todos los
nombres y detalles necesarios para desenmascarar a Fidel Castro y sus agentes.

**SOURCE**:  
Medium-level member of the Mexican Communist Party in the Laguna area whose Party position requires attendance at policy-making meetings. The reporting on Communist activities has been reliable.

On 19-21 August 1966 the Union of Local Societies of Collective Farms Credit 40-66 (USCC 40-66 - Unión de Sociedades de Crédito Ejidal 40-66), a Mexican Communist Party (PCM) (Partido Comunista Mexicano) peasant effort, held the 8th Regional Congress at the USCC 40-66 headquarters in Torreón, Coahuila, with an attendance of about 1,000 people. Every state in Mexico was represented. The meeting was presided over by Arturo Oroña Calas, member of the PCM Central Committee and Secretary for Peasants. 

The speakers were: Arnold Martínez Verdugo, First Secretary of the PCM Central Committee, and Agustín Botello Gómez, Secretary of Organization of the PCM Coahuila State Committee. Conspicuous by their absence were Antonio Martín Rodríguez, member of the PCM Presidium with special interest in PCM political affairs in the Laguna area, and Blanca Reyes, member of the PCM Central Committee who lived in the Torreón area. The main theme of the Congress was the aim of the USCC 40-66 to promote the nationalization of all privately held agricultural land in the Laguna area. It wants to divide all land in the Laguna area into communal farms and completely do away with small private land holdings. 

Martínez pointed that the Mexican Government was trying to plot against the PCM and gave as an example the 12-13 August 1966 arrest of Victor Rico Galiano and 40 others of the Popular Revolutionary Movement (Movimiento Revolucionario del Pueblo). He said that the PCM did not expouse the armed revolutionary policies of Calas, and that the Party was pacifist.

1. The Administrative Council for the USCC 40-66 which was elected on 21 August at the above Congress is as follows:
   - Manager:                                        Arturo Orona Cans
   - Assistant Manager, in charge of: 
     - Commerce and Insurance:                        Aquilino Borrel Cano
     - Social Serv.:                                  Alberto Lucio Juarez
     - Machinery:                                     Alberto Munoz
     - Agricultural Livestock:                        Jesus Ceja
     - Organization:                                  Ramon Espinosa Delgado
     - Fruit Growers:                                 Juan Francisco Espinosa
     - Agrarian Organization:                          Crut Chacon Sifuentes 2

3. Also present at the USCC 40-66 Congress was Oscar Guajardo Cuellar, Secretary of Organization of the PCM Nuevo Leon State Committee. He was trying to organize an interchange of ideas between the Nuevo Leon and Coahuila PCM State Committees, especially in the field of organizing new calls. Guajardo said that he had organized various neighborhood committees to contact the police and the government. He was especially interested in contacting Oscar de la Rosa and Jose Luis Ortiz, former Secretary of the PCM Coahuila State Committee.

> Source Comment: Martinez Verdugo was trying to get the support of the crowd.

Headquarters received a report on this Congress and the speech made by Martinez Verdugo on 21 August 1966, the closing day, reported in issues no. 1245 and 1246, dated 29 August and 2 September 1966, respectively, of La Voz de Mexico, official newspaper of the PCM. The second part of the speech in no. 1360 is extremely interesting. In that Martinez Verdugo takes issue with the manner in which General Lazaro Cardenas del Rio, former President of Mexico (1934-1940), proposes to achieve agrarian reform. Further, Martinez Verdugo orders Cardenas again giving his political support to President Diaz Ordonez, as he said on 11 August at Ciudad Altamirano, Guerrero, when he also expressed his views on agrarian reform (cf. Airwaves no. 161, Joint Mexico no. 32, dated 12 August 1966, through the American Embassy, Mexico City).

2. Field Comment: All of the members of this USCC 40-66 Administrative Council are members of the PCM.

1. The plenum of the Central Committee of the Mexican Communist Party (PCM - Partido Comunista Mexicano) will take place in Mexico City on 25, 26, and 27 September 1966.  
2. The Campesino Congress of Torreón was attended by Oscar Gijardo Gutiérrez of the Nuevo León State Committee. Gijardo will remain in Torreón until 24 August to attend the national plenum of the Independent Peasants' Central (CCI - Central Campesino Independiente) which is being held concurrently with the Campesino Congress.  
3. Lino Medina Salazar, in his capacity as member of the Central Committee and member of the National Trade Union Commission, was in Monterrey from 17 to 19 August to participate in a meeting of the State Committee to discuss the Party's trade union activities, because so little has been done in this field which the Party has had difficulties in penetrating. It was agreed that the publication of **Acción Sindical**, which has been dormant for some time, would be resumed as an initial step in planning trade union activity and that a study of the labor situation should be undertaken. Medina, who was not pleased with the outcome of the meeting, promised to return and to personally follow the progress of the trade union program since he is the Central Committee member responsible for supervising the activities of the Party in Nuevo León.

### 4.
A meeting of members of the Independent Central of People's Organizations (I.U.C.P - Central Independente de Organizaciones del Pueblo) was held on 19 August to discuss plans to carry out institutional activities early in September in support of budgetary and other unionized groups.  

### 5.
The campaign in support of political prisoners has been suspended until 25 September. The situation has become more complicated because of the recent increase in the number of prisoners, although in Nuevo Leon there have been no repercussions because of the roundup of the Ugalde-Rico Galan groups.  

### 6.
With regard to the national meeting of university students, it cannot be said that it was successful since only three delegates were present - those from Nuevo Leon, Chihuahua, and Salisco. Arnoldo Martinez Verdugo, Jose Encarnacion PEREZ Gaytan, and other members of the Party Presidium were present, which suggests that the Party attaches considerable importance to this program for university action. This meeting was considered to be the first stage, to be followed by others. It is presumed within the Party that the Nuevo Leon State Committee de exprese in university matters since it organized the University of Nuevo Looq Union (STUNL - Sindicato de la Universidad de Nuevo Leon).  

### 7.
With respect to the PCN's electoral campaign, no candidates have been agreed upon, and it is clear that among those under consideration none is of impressive stature.  

### 8.
Of interest are the efforts of Porfirio Diaz, head of the National Youth Institute in Monterrey, who is departing from the Party line in attempting to form a youth group in which the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI - el gobierno party) would participate along with the PCM and other leftist organizations. Diaz has held meetings attended by Octavio Leal Moncada of the I.U.C.P, Javier Mojica Santoval of the PCM, Jose Luis Sustaita of the National Democratic Students' Council (CNED - Central Nacional de Estudiantes Democraticos), other members of the PCM, and representatives of the PRI.  

### Headquarters Comments:
Issue No. 1845, dated 28 Aug. 1966, of La Voz de Mexico, official newspaper for the PCM, reported that the Union of Sociedades de Credito Ejidal de La Cosecha Lagunera 1940-1965 (USCELX-1910-1965), headed by Arturo Ortega Galiz, held VIII Ordinary Congress in the headquarters at Torreon, Coahuila. Issue No. 1846, dated 2 September 1966, contained an article dated Torreon, Coahuila, August 1966, stating that the national plenary of the CIL had resolved to disassociate itself from the National Liberation Movement (MIL-Movimiento de Liberacion Nacional), because of the latter's divisional activities.  

> **Note:** In fact, the SU was founded by the Party since, when it was organized, there were no Constituting authorities and other university workers. The union came into being as a result of the activities of a group of teachers from Estrategico School; it had the support of the then acting Rector, Alfonso Angel Guerra, who saw in the union possibilities for creating problems for Eduardo Luis Villareal, the Governor of Nuevo Leon. It was almost a year later that Rolando Guzman, founder of the union, and Ernesto Salazar joined the PCN, but their influence in the union cannot be attributed to this fact. The union has continued to assert itself and has maintained its activities within legal bounds, demanding intrinsic wages without obtaining the results required from local authorities responsible for this sector; in addition, Guzman, Cunneles, and Salazar, there were only four or five other union members. The possibility of forming a national university union under PCM seems to be remote, and it is doubtful that present plans to this direction will ever materialize.

>
> Field Comment: The 7 September 1966 issue of Sieme[?] magazine, which appeared on the stands on 1 September, carried on pages 10 and 11 an article written from prison by Victor Rico Galan explaining and defending his position and accusing the Mexican Government of being the real violators of the Constitution. On the following pages an editorial titled “Mexico No Es Una Isla Inundada de Goril[a]” (Mexico Is Not A Police State), which rejected the points put forth by Rico Galan, defended Mexican institutions and concluded that because of the ‘señorita’ devotion to freedom of expression, time and space had been devoted to what should properly be recorded as a minor police incident.

1. Inés de Rico Galan, wife of Sieme[?] writer Victor Rico Galan, said on 2 September 1966 that her husband was resigning from Sieme[?] because of the harsh editorial against him and his ideas which appeared in the 7 September issue of the magazine. Mrs. Rico Galan said that the editorial was far harsher than even President Gustavo Díaz Ordaz’ comments on the matter, which he included in his 1 September State of the Union message.

2. If Siempref refuses to publish her husband's letter of resigna-  
tion, and she seemed to feel that this might be the case,  
Manuel Maruco Padrinas[?] left a "magazine" Politica and has assured Rico that he will publish.  

3. On 6 September, the journalist Froilan Manjarrez told Antonio  
Carias, of the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina, that Eduardo de  
Los Rios (Rius), the political cartoonist, had resigned from  
Siempref in protest over the magazine's treatment of Rico  
Galan. Since it was doubtful that Siempref would publish Rius'  
letter of resignation, arrangements have already been made  
with Marco Padrinas to publish it in Political.  

4. Manjarrez remarked that Siempref publisher Jose Pace Lleras  
had bloundered badly in his handling of the Rico Galan affair  
and that people who had never been especially sympathetic to  
Rico Galan were nonetheless totally disgusted with Pages  
[Rico] is being spoken of as a brave man and Pages as a  
despicable one, according to Manjarrez, as a result of the  
editorial?  

> Field Comments: C3-311/1295-66 reported that it was uncertain that  
Politics would continue to publish after the 15 August 1966 issue.  

2. Headquarters Comments: The 14 September 1966 issue of Siempref carried  
a letter to the editor written by Rico Galin, in which he expressed his  
intense displeasure with the publication's editorial of the previous  
week. He asked that Manjarrez consider withdrawing his intention to continue  
collaborating with its book section, saying that he would seek some  
support for his royal deposits, his commitment, that they may live in  
a manner worthy of revolutionary solidarity, not from ideas grafted by  
evil connivences seeking for similar tranquility. In a note of reply,  
Siempref reiterated its disagreement with Rico Galin's viewpoint but  
added that it claimed neither to qualify nor to judge the personal  
conduct of a friend who was the magazine's permanently bound.

1.  Rolando Collado Ardon, leader of the Guatemalan exile community in Mexico and a member of the Guatemalan Communist Party (PGT), said that the arrest of Victor Rico Galán on charges of subversion was a good thing for the PGT. Collado was referring to Rico Galán's influence on Guatemalan guerrilla leader Marco Antonio Yon Sosa. According to Collado, Rico Galán prevented the PGT from persuading Yon Sosa to join the Party in 1963 because of Rico's Trotskyist interference, and the aid he gave to Yon Sosa at the time.

2.  Medical doctors Miguel Cruz Ruiz and Rolí Monier Huebner, two of those arrested with Rico Galán, have been associated with Rico since early 1965. Both were very much involved in the medical doctor's strikes of late 1964, which continued into 1965. When the strikes were finally settled both Cruz Ruiz and Huebner were dismissed from their jobs at the Social Security Hospital at Cuauhtemoc 330. They went directly to a magazine Sucesos for which Rico Galán worked.

3.  Rico Galán sent both Cruz Ruiz and Monier Huebner to Cuba in 1965 and both are well indoctrinated Communists. However, neither belongs to any Communist Party or organization. Both, as well as Dr. Jorge Velzer Trojo, also very active during the medical strikes, have traveled through Latin America making...

## Field Comments
1. In October-November 1963, Rico Galan, ostensibly as a purely journalistic exercise, went to Guatemala where he interviewed Yon Sosa in the guerrilla leader's camp.

   > **Headquarters Comment:** This report, however, does not give the names of Drs. Cruz and Meiner as having been invited to attend the XI Medical Congress and the VII National Stomatology Congress but states that Rico Galan, who was making ticket arrangements, had names of others invited to the Congresses.

> UNSOLICITED INFORMATION; SOURCE GRADINGS ARE DEFINITIVE. APPRAISAL OF CONTENT IS TENTATIVE.

**SOURCE**: Mexican security officer with access to information derived from investigative activities. His reporting is believed to be reliable.

1. At a meeting of leaders of the Mexican Communist Party (PCM - Partido Comunista Mexicano) attended by Arnold Martinez Verdugo, Fernando Granados Cortes, Manuel Terrazas Guerrero, Gerardo Unzueta Lorenzana, and Marcos Leonel Posadas Seguro, there was some discussion of the status of members of the group, headed by Victor Rico Galan and Raul Uvalde Alvarez, which was recently arrested for engaging in subversive activities. It was revealed at this meeting that Ugalde had submitted an application for membership in the PCM but that he had not been accepted. He is not, therefore, considered to be a member of the Party. The same is true of Guillermo Balas-Porrua. It is true that Venancio Garay Zuniga and Artiño Garay Zuniga are PCM members, but they aligned themselves with the Rico Galan "guerrilla" group on instructions from the Party to serve as spies in order to keep the Party informed on the group's activities.

2. At a meeting of the Permanent Committee of the National Assembly for the Freedom of Political Prisoners, Filomeno Mata Alatorre stated that he was completely removed from the subversive group and that he had had nothing whatsoever to do with it. Guillermo Calderon Ita raised the question of the most recent group of prisoners (the Rico Galan group), and it was agreed that that group had chosen the easy path - that of taking up arms; that such a movement would come about eventually, but that now is not the time; there is no chance for success of an armed movement. It was agreed that even though the Committee ...

was not in accord with the tactics, or even the ideology, of the Rico Galan group; the latter group should be rendered in the same way as other political prisoners. The Rico Galan group has engaged the same lawyers used by the Committee. In fact, the campaign in behalf of political prisoners must be pursued with even greater vigor because under the present Mexican Government policy the PCI on the Popular Socialist Party (PPS - Partido Popular Socialista) could be accused of operating schools for training of subversives. At the close of the meeting, it was reported that a message had been received from the Fourth Latin American Students’ Congress (CLAE) in Havana advising that as part of the campaign for the Release of Political Prisoners, which will be highlighted during the period 25 September to 2 October 1966, telegrams will be sent to the President of Mexico from all countries in Latin America.

### Field Comments

1. While there does not appear to be any firm evidence of Ugalde's membership in the PCM, his activities as a leading figure in the People's Electoral Front (PZF - Frente Electoral del Pueblo), which is controlled by the PCM, have been well reported.

2. In a document seized by Mexican police during a raid on PCM headquarters on 12 April 1955, Dr. Bulos Ferreira was listed as a member of the Dr. Angel Martínez Villareal cell, having joined the Party in August 1964.

3. According to the Mexico City daily, El Día, of 30 August 1966, the office of the Attorney General for the Federal District protected against the actions of a Federal District judge in releasing the Garay Zuniga brothers from custody on 22 August.

1. According to Inge de Rico, wife of Victor Rico Galan who was arrested on 12 August and who has been charged with conspiring against the Mexican Government, her husband is quite well. She said that she is allowed to see him every day, and to take him food, clothing, books, papers, and other things which he has requested. She also said that friends have been very kind. In fact, her husband has told her that he wants the money which has been offered to him to be shared among the other prisoners who have none and who are trying to get bond.

2. As to her husband's chances for being released on bail, she said that a number of legal experts on this type of case have been consulted and their opinions have been rather pessimistic.

3. [illegible: appears to be approximately 2 words] has been asked to have her husband prepare a message for students at the University and in some of the preparatory Schools who are urging that he be freed. Many of Rico's readers are young students who greatly admire him.

> Veterans and trusted associates of the Popular Socialist Party who has close personal connections with ranking members of the Party. He has been a prolific reporter of reliable information. The reported information was cited directly from leaders of both the Pri and the General Union of Workers and Peasants of Mexico. The substance of these person's accounts is believed to be accurately reported; its validity, however, cannot be assessed.

1. **(Summary):** Popular Socialist Party (PPS) attitudes toward the arrest of Victor Rico Calan and others on charges of conspiring against the Government remain unsympathetic. The Party intends to stay outside the entire matter, although PPS Sec. attorney General Vicente Lombardo Toledano may seize the opportunity to strike at some of his critics by insulting them. Within the Party there is considerable skepticism about the truth of the published claims. While several Party leaders do not doubt that there is some truth to the charge, they are quick convinced that there was no danger of imminent retribution and that Mexican institutions stood in no peril from Calan and his friends. The suggestion recently made in Calan's case...

   > Also, it is believed in the PPS that police accounts of their role in the matter have been exaggerated to enhance the reputation of the police both with the President and with the public. The rumor that the Guatemalan Government may have asked the Mexican Government to silence Rico Calan because of his violent attacks against the new Guatemalan administration is generally discounted.

2. Victor Rico Galan and his associates can expect neither sympathy nor help from the Popular Socialist Party (PPS - Partido Popular Socialista). Although no official decision has been made by the Party, PPS leaders who have commented unofficially on the matter have said that for them the Party will no doubt stay completely outside the whole affair, thus proving its total lack of interest in this type of revolutionary activity. It is, of course, possible that PPS Secretary General Vicente Lombardo Toledano will seize the opportunity to issue a statement concerning the entire affair as opportunist, criminal, and subversive. Lombardo may decide to use this opportunity to strike back at the National Liberation Movement (MLN - Movimiento de Liberación Nacional) and others who have attacked him.

3. Among leaders of both the PPS and the General Union of Workers and Peasants of Mexico (UGOCM - Unión General de Obreros y Campesinos de México), there is a certain skepticism about the truth of the matter as it has been presented in the press. It is probably true that arms and materials for manufacturing explosives were confiscated. It is probably true that indoctrination sessions on political and revolutionary matters were held in the houses where the arrests were made. And probably the group that has shown kind of plan for action is simply not true that there was the slightest danger of immediate and formidable rebellion from Rico Galan and his associates.

4. This latter conclusion is based on the fact that Rico Galan is no guerilla leader. He is an aggressive intellectual, but radical, but he is not in jail for what he has done but for his ideas, as for Raul Silva Alvarez, named with Rico Galan as one of the leaders of the group, he has the reputation of being fuzzy-minded, a leftist troublemaker and certainly neither brave nor dedicated. Neither, and Rico Galan is well aware of this, popular support is essential to the success of revolution in the country. The peasants are divided. The workers are content with very things are. Also, there is the forbadable precedent of Government acting against any kind of rebellion, trade union, and particularly any sort of activity which is Cuban-connected. The Government has always moved with energy, speed, and efficiency to combat such threats; for example, during the Railway Workers' Strike of 1959. Several leaders of that strike are still in jail and likely to remain there. Another example is the September 1965 attack on a military camp at Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, while the Government did not fear this incident posed any real threat to it, it did want the bad instrumental publicity, so while violence was increased, recruits of would-be guerrillas were blocked, some were bought off with money, others with promises, and the matter was promptly and efficiently controlled.

5. There could be a degree of truth to police charges, but to say that Rico Galan has anything like a child’s character given the actions of Galan himself, the lack of any proven connection between the leaders and public support of the Cuban revolution, make it very hard to expect any serious violent reaction to the Government maneuver. Also, while the police no doubt did confiscate arms and materials, the suspicion exists that it does not look good both to the President and to public opinion.

6. There is even a rumor that because of Rico Galán's harsh attacks on the new Guatemalan administration, the Guatemalan Government asked the Mexican Government to deal with Rico Galán. This rumor, however, is regarded as rather ridiculous, since the Mexican Government certainly cares nothing for the opinion of Guatemalan officials.

1. Field Correspondence: TGC-314/1019-66, 18 August 1966, reported earlier PFB reaction to the arrests.

   Headquarters Comments: In his inaugural address in December 1964, President *[?Name?]* made no point of stressing his desire for harmonious relations with Mexico's neighbors both to the north and to the south. His Central American trip in mid-January 1965 was, among other things, to promote such relations—Guatemalan friendship has lately been said to be a cardinal objective of Mexican foreign policy (cf. State telegram no. 1215, dated 30 August 1966, from the American Embassy in Mexico City).

**SOURCE:** Mexican intellectual who is a personal friend of Victor Rico Galan, although they disagree politically. Source has reported infrequently but reliably on Rico Galan's activities. The reported information was obtained from Mrs. Rico Galan and from a journalist.

**Field Comment:** The 7 September 1966 issue of *Siempre* magazine (which appeared on the stands on 1 September) carried on pages 10 and 11 a letter written from prison by Victor Rico Galan, explaining and defending his position and accusing the Mexican Government of being the real violators of the Constitution. On the following pages, an editorial titled *Mexico No Es Una Insula de Gorilas* (Mexico is Not a Police State) which rejected all the points put forth by Rico Galan, defended Mexican institutions and concluded with the observation that time and space had been devoted to what history would properly record as a minor incident because of the magazine's devotion to freedom of expression.

1. Inés de Rico Galan, wife of Sleeper, writer Victor Rico Galan, said on 7 September 1965, that her husband was receiving true substantial benefits of his harsh editorial against him and his ideas, which appeared in the 7 September issue of the magazine. Mrs. Rico Galan said that the editorial was far harsher than even President Gustavo Díaz Ordaz's comments on the matter, which included in his 7 September State of the Union message.

## 1. 

Siemple* refuse to publish her husband's letter of resignation and she seemed to feel that this might be the case, Manuel* Marcus Pardinos of the Communist newspaper Politica has assured Rico that he will publish it in Politica.

## 3.

On 6 September, the journalist Troilan Manjarres told Antonio Cárdenas of the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina that Eduardo de Rios (Rios), the political cartoonist, had resigned from Siemple, in protest over the magazine's treatment of Rico Galán. Since it was doubtful that Siemple will publish Rios' letter of resignation, arrangements have already been made with Marcus Pardinos to publish it in Politica.

## 4.

Manjarres reported that Siemple's publisher Jose Pagan Liergo had blundered badly into handling of the Rico Galán issue, and that people who had never been especially sympathetic to Rico Galán were none-the-less totally disgusted with Pagan. Rico is being spoken of as a brave man and Pagan as a contemptible one, according to Manjarres, as a result of the editorial.

---

1. **Field Comment**: HHM-10,625 reported that it was uncertain whether Politica would continue to publish after the 15 August issue.

## SOURCE

Mexican intellectual who is a personal friend of Victor Rico Galan although she disagrees with him politically. Source has reported infrequently on Rico Galan's activities. The reported information was obtained from Mrs. Rico Galan.

1. According to Ingo Rico Galan, wife of Victor Rico Galan who was arrested on 12 August and who has been charged with conspiracy against the Mexican Government, her husband is quite well. She said that she is allowed to see him every day and to take him food, clothing, books, papers, and other things that he has asked for. She said also that friends have been very kind. In fact, her husband has told her that he wants the money which has been offered to him to be shared among the other prisoners who have gone and who are trying to get bond.

2. As to her husband's chances for being released on bail, Mrs. Rico Galan said that a number of local experts on this kind of case have been consulted and their opinions have been rather pessimistic.

3. Mrs. Rico Galan was also asked to have her husband prepare a message for students at the university and in some of the preparatory schools who are urging that he be freed. Many of Rico's readers are young students who greatly admire him.

> *Field Comment: An independent, usually reliable source reported that the National Liberation Movement (MLN) had taken $120.00 (U.S.) from its pro-Vietnam fund and given it to Rico Galan. Also, Ramon Zorrilla, teacher at the...*
