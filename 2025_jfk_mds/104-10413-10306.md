# SECRET  
April 1977  

## SUBJECT: Theory re MOSKALEV, Yuriy Ivanovich and Unidentified Man  

That Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV might be identifiable with the "unidentified man" going into and coming out of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City in October 1963. The "unidentified man" was recently identified by SLIPSTREAM as a KGB type by name of "Yuri" whom he knew in Moscow in 1964.  

- According to travel records MOSKALEV was in the USSR in 1964; in the U.S. in October 1963.  
- MOSKALEV functions officially as a Soviet scientist and often attends international conferences. He has been in contact with known GRU Soviet diplomat in the U.S.  

MOSKALEV bears a striking resemblance to composite of "Saul" in book *Appointment in Dallas* who claims he was involved in the assassination of President Kennedy. "Saul" claims:
- he crossed border into U.S. illegally and was in Dallas on 20 November.  
- That he had been to Mexico City, had a contact in Soviet Embassy there, in 1963, and that he knew the identity of OSWALD because he (OSWALD) had been fingered to him in Mexico City.
```

[Page 7]

```markdown
- that OSWALD was involved in the Kennedy assassination plot, but that he, "Saul", fired shots that killed Kennedy.

- that two hours after the assassination he, "Saul", was out of the U.S. That he used limp as a disguise.

## QUESTIONS
1. Could MOSKALEV be "Saul"?
2. Could MOSKALEV, therefore, be mystery man who boarded plane in Mexico City for Havana on 22 November 1963?
3. Was assassination a Soviet conspiracy without Cuban knowledge?

## RECOMMENDATION
1. Can we obtain voice tape of MOSKALEV, since he has delivered speeches at scientific conferences in U.S. and abroad?
2. If so, could we arrange to have McDonald (unwittingly) hear it, to see if he recognizes it as that of "Saul"?

1. Can we find ,hotc that PENKOVSKIY identified of MOSKALEVSKIY.
2. May I see PENKOVSKIY's 201 file for period 61-63?
3. Get photos and check out MOISEEV and BABKOV.
4. Via CI Staff, find out if we can show photo to DERYABIN and ROSTVOROFF?
5. Could MOSKALEV be Dept 13? Could OSWALD have met with him in Mexico City clandestinely in 1963?

# Document Title

26 Dec 62 - CIA=A-3.246.539  
Re International Conference on Diagnosis  
and Treatment of Radioactive Poisoning,  
Vienna, Aust. 15-18 Oct 62. "Most  
interesting aspect of meeting was conduct  
and contributions of Prof. MOSKALEV of  
USSR Academy of Sciences. His subject was  
listed as "Uptake and Retention of  
Plutonium in Man"; no abstract was  
presented. When he spoke he changed the  
title to "Problems of Kinetics of Uptake  
and Retention of Radioisotopes." His  
paper presented nothing new and can be  
described as elementary. He apparently  
spoke no English.

19 Jan 63 - OOB 3,248,156  
Information from another source on the  
above conference. Dr. D. J. SEMENOV and  
Dr. I.T. TRUGUBENKO [?] were invited to  
attend. The Soviets sent instead, Prof.  
MOSKALEV. He was bright, but not  
individual who should have been sent  
representing the USSR at this meeting.  
Was [illegible: appears to be approximately 5 words] said to be his first time out  
of the USSR. /CDH comment - not so.

9 July 63 - DF-440  
Source: AEDAZZLE-1 (doi 1961) identified  
photo (not by name, nor was name supplied)  
as that of Col. Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEVSKIY.  
Air Force Col. and [illegible: approximately 10 characters] in  
Information Directorate of [illegible: appears to be approximately 5 characters] who attended  
"a meeting" in London in May or June 1961.

21 Aug 63 - OOB 3,271,609  
MOSKALEV participated at meeting of IAEA  
panel on Toxicity of Incorporated Radio-  
nuclides, Vienna, Austria 4-8 June 63.

### 18 Oc^ 63  
OOB 3,278,069  
Re Symposium in Vienna, Austria from 26-31 August 63. The Soviets sent a small three or four member delegation headed by MOSKALEV "a very personable and diplomatic gentleman." At the end of the conference MOSKALEV voiced his dismay that the Soviets had misunderstood the exact point of the meeting and had presented very minor papers.

### 3 Dec 63  
OOB 3,283,411  
Symposium on Radiological Health and Safety in Nuclear Materials Mining & Milling, Vienna, Austria late Aug 63. "Due to misunderstanding in USSR, topics covered by symposium were not known sufficiently in advance for Soviet scientists to contribute papers on other than nuclear toxicology." All papers were given by Dr. L. N. BURYKINA in the absence of MOSKALEV et al.

  IAEA Symposium on Neutron Irradiation, Brookhaven, Long Island, N.Y. Oct 63.  
  MOSKALEV, one of the Soviet delegates, was frequent commentator on other people's work and made a practice of denigrating their reports with respect to radiation lethality.  
  Sources (3 U.S. scientists) were asked if they thought MOSKALEV's objectives were motivated from anything more than genuine scientific position. They responded, "Who can say?" MOSKALEV, both from papers he gave and his questions and comments in discussion, indicated he was very sharp. The paper he gave presented no new data. His paper said nothing specific.

## 24 Oct 66 
- OOB 321,15482-66  
  About one third of the Soviets expected at the Third Int'l Congress of Radiation Research put in appearance. The papers were disappointing. A paper written by MOSKALEV and V.A. STRELTSOVA was not impressive.

## 16 Oct 67 
- OOB 321,30340-67  
  MOSKALEV attended the Second Int'l Symposium on Delayed Effects of Bone Seeking Radio Nuclides, Sun Valley, Idaho, 12-14 Sept 67. He presented an interesting paper. He was not expected at the meeting and came alone, arriving two days early. He had furnished no brief and it was a surprise to hear his presence. He understands English reasonably well, but speaks it less well. Therefore, his appearance alone at the conference was even more unusual. He became very interested in visiting a certain U.S. facility and pursued arrangements to visit U.S. Gov't.

**16 Oct 67**  -  **OOB 321,27474-67**

MOSKALEV participated in Second Int'l Symposium on Delayed Effects of Bone Seeking Radio Nuclides, Sun Valley, Idaho, arriving two days early. He had travelled alone to Sun Valley and apparently was able to use his knowledge of English language to get along on his own. However, he complained to Chairman of conference that he did not know enough English to read his paper which also required condensation because it was too long for the time allowed. A colleague who had known MOSKALEV from previous meetings said MOSKALEV's knowledge of English improved greatly after a few drinks. However, he did not drink at all during this conference. He had written the English version of the paper he presented himself. A respected U.S. scientist with more experience than MOSKALEV said frankly did not believe MOSKALEV's findings. (Said this in private.) MOSKALEV attempted to make propaganda of a report by a West German. MOSKALEV left the conference a little upset. He took copious notes on all papers, which indicated he understood what was going on. He also took many pictures with a 35 mm camera. From questions he asked in private, it was obvious he understood English quite well. Considerable time was spent in arranging visit to a U.S. lab. in route to his home. He took a different route, without telling anyone of plans and did not visit the lab.

Four Soviet scientists, MOSKALEV, MOISEEV, MEJOT, and MASSE, participated at the same Transuranium Biology Symposium at Hanford during the week of Sept 26. They were in San Francisco by chance at the same time and desired to visit Berkeley on the same day. They did not travel to the conference together. It all seemed to be coincidental. Dr. MOSKALEV and MASSE reportedly understood more English than they could speak. Dr. MOSKALEV was the USSR's rep. on ICRP internal data committee.

## MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD  

**SUBJECT:** Possible Identity of the "Unidentified Man"  
Photographed in Mexico City in October 1963  

**REFERENCES:**  
A. Photos Taken in Mexico City by Mexico City Station  
B. Paperback Boo* "Appointment in Dallas"  
C. So*t File, Headquarters Information on Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALЁV, Possible "Unidentified Man"  

1. Photographs of the unidentified man were taken by our Mexico City Station on 2, 3, 4, and 15 October 1963, going into or coming out of both the Cuban and Soviet Embassies in Mexico City. Copies were provided to the FBI in Dallas, Texas on 22 November 1963. Although cropped copies have appeared in various works, including Volume XX, page 691, of the Warren Commission Report, and the book "Appointment in Dallas", to our knowledge the individual has never been identified.

2. On 17 March 1977, a former member of the Cuban General Directorate of Intelligence (DGI) recognized photographs of the unidentified man as Yuri LNU, a KGB officer, whom he met in Moscow in 1964 while attending an intelligence course there. He said that Yuri, a fluent English and Spanish speaker, was acting as a trouble shooter for the Cuban group, about 15, attending the course. Yuri lived with

the Cuban and Bulgarian groups quartered in the same building in Moscow. Any time the Cubans had a problem, Yuri would solve it for them. Yuri was a good friend of Juan (pseudo) a KGB officer who taught the Cubans about the Agency (CIA) and the West German intelligence apparatus. Juan told the DGI member that he had served in Mexico for about 20 years and in the U.S. clandestinely for about 10 years (specific dates unknown). Yuri was entrusted with their welfare only, and did not attend classes with the Cuban group.

3. SE/X travel records were reviewed in search of an individual by the name of Yuri who possibly fit the description of the unidentified man. This lead to an individual by the name of Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV, a Soviet, reportedly a Doctor of Medical Sciences, who has participated in international scientific conferences for the USSR since 1962 or earlier. Although there is no official 201 file on MOSKALEV, there is a sizable dossier on him in the Central Reference Service. Many of the documents in his dossier are OO reports from U.S. scientists concerning MOSKALEV's attendance and behavior at scientific meetings. It is obvious that he has a much greater knowledge of the English language than he admits. His capability is said to improve greatly after a few drinks; however, it is noted that he rarely, if ever, drank at the scientific meetings. It is also noted that on [?occasions?] he reportedly was not qualified to represent the Soviets at a particular conference. His papers rarely, if ever, were specific, or presented new data.

Following are items of interest from selected documents in MOSKALEV's CRS dossier:

a. In 1961 PENKOVSKY identified a photo (with no name provided) as that of Col. Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEVSKIY, Air Force Col. and GRU officer in the Information Directorate of the GRU.

b. [In December 1963 the FBI reported]

c. In October 1963 MOSKALEV was a delegate to the IAEA Symposium on Neutron Irradiation, Brookhaven, Long Island, New York. Described by U.S. scientists as very sharp, MOSKALEV was a frequent commentator on other people's work and made a practice of denigrating their reports with respect to radiation lethality.

his knowledge of the English language to get along on his own.  
Although he complained about not knowing much English, he  
admitted writing the English version of the paper he presented.  
MOSKALEV attempted to make propaganda of a paper by a West  
German scientist. A respected U.S. scientist said he frankly  
did not believe MOSKALEV's findings. MOSKALEV took copious  
notes on all papers, which indicated he understood what was  
going on. He also took many pictures with a 35 mm camera.  
From questions MOSKALEV asked, it was obvious that he knew  
English quite well. Although considerable time was spent  
arranging for MOSKALEV to visit a U.S. laboratory en route to  
his home, he took a different route, without telling anyone  
of his plans, and did not visit the lab.

4. On 23 March 1977 several identification experts of the Disguise and Identification Section of OTS/GAD compared photos of the unidentified man with photos of **Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV** from the FBI, British Liaison, and CRS.  
It was their opinion that MOSKALEV could very likely be identifiable with the unidentified man.

5. Page 59 of the book "Appointment in Dallas," shows an Identi-Kit Model composite of an individual who told the author in London in 1972 that he was involved in the assassination of President Kennedy. The composite of that individual (code name "Saul"), whose real name is unknown to the author, bears a striking resemblance to the photos of Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV. According to the author "Saul" identified the picture shown in the Warren Commission Exhibit #237 as having been taken at the Russian Embassy in Mexico City, either in the foyer or just outside.

6. The author of the aforementioned book, Hugh C. McDonald, 
   is the inventor of the Identi-Kit and at one time was under 
   contract to CIA in regard to the Identi-Kit. McDonald claims 
   in his book that he met "Saul" at an office in CIA Headquarters 
   sometime after the Bay of Pigs invasion, and that a colleague 
   of McDonald told him that "Saul" was an assassin.

7. There are striking parallels between the backgrounds 
   of "Saul" as given in McDonald's book, and MOSKALEV. For example:

   ### "Saul"
   Pg. 7 - CIA allegedly knew of Saul. McDonald said he first 
   met Saul in CIA Hqs. CIA took picture of Saul that started 
   McDonald's investigation.

   Pg. 59 - See Identi-Kit composite of "Saul".

   Pg. 60/61 - McDonald states it was obvious that FBI and CIA 
   were compromised at the very top since both Agencies denied 
   knowledge of "Saul". No one wanted to hear anymore about him.

   According to Office of Security, McDonald has been in touch with 
   CIA in relation to his Identi-Kit. His states he was a cleared 
   source of LAFO/DCS - doi September 1969. (contract agent) 
   It is true that Mexico City Station took photos of "Saul" 
   that McDonald claimed started his investigation.

   CDH comment: See photos of Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV. He 
   bears striking resemblance to "Saul."

   Helms, the DDP testified under oath that he didn't know "Saul."

# Pg. 69 
McDonald began his search of "Saul" in 1970. It began, he said, with a call from an unidentified woman who arranged a meeting in London and told him she believed the Russians had a germ warfare installation in Vozrozdenya, in the Aral Sea. McDonald obtained CIA approval to make contact.

# Pg. 70 
In Germany in 1945 McDonald knew of 12 people (Poles, Czechs, Rumanians, Germans, Scandinavians, 2 Russians) who feared and hated Russia. They formed an organization to observe, analyze, and report all future activities within Russia and Russia's sphere of control. Most had legitimate jobs.

# Pg. 71 
24 Sept 70 McDonald left for London with "Saul's" picture. McDonald said both he and Saul were contract men for CIA. Saul did dangerous jobs for private interests.

# Pg. 73 
McDonald learned that on the Island of Vozrozdenya, Aral Sea, germ warfare was being planned against U.S. (Russians transmit germs in jet streams). 

![No description available for image](image) 
**Description of image:** The image features text from the document discussing McDonald's activities and investigations related to germ warfare and his connections in Russia. The layout presents a series of paragraphs that document specific events and insights.

> Note MOSKALEV's scientific background and travel. He was in the U.K. in 68, 70, 71 and 72. Background is biophysics. MOSKALEV's (GRU) contact BUBNOV/"specialized in chemical warfare".

MOSKALEV was allegedly imprisoned during war because of his German descent or for black market dealings. Could he be a double agent?

McDonald met Saul in London July 72. MOSKALEV travel shows him in London Nov 72.

**Pg. 95** - At hospital he was orderly by name of Ivan. There were other young interns, orderlies, etc., there.

**Pg. 99** - Some months before Kennedy was killed, an inquiry was being circulated, about this man (Saul). Someone wanted to contact him. Word went out that someone needed his services.

**Pg. 109** - An alleged former (McDonald called Kimsey) Agency employee said the scheme which "Saul" described *to kill the president* could not possibly have been activated without help from very high places in this country. (U.S.)

**Pg. 117** - Saul did not know he was being called Saul.

**Pg. 119** - Saul told Kimsey that he often used limp as part of his disguises.

**Pg. 120** - In Zurick in 1972 McDonald saw four men. Three Arabic and one who had a blunt, Slavic fact with a broad-typed nose, about 40.

Could this have been MOSKALEV's middle name is Ivanovich; so is BUBNOV's.

```markdown
# Pg. 121
Kimsey felt that Saul was a middle-European, so probably grew up with German as second language. "Saul" spoke English like an American.

# Pg. 143
"Saul," said he came back to the U.S. for a short period one time, lived in Southern Calif. for about a month, or six weeks, then moved to Mexico. Said business was good in Mexico, and that made it easy, or easier, to try to make contact with whoever was trying to make contact with him.

# Pg. 164
"Saul" said a contact he named Troît would have OSWALD in Mexico City 26 Sept to 3 Oct[?] and that OSWALD would call on both the Cuban Consul and Soviet Consul. "Saul" said he did not have a photo of OSWALD but had a contact in the Soviet Embassy would do the job (identify OSWALD) for him. Saul said OSWALD did show up in Mexico City and was fingered to him. He sat close to him in restaurants and cafeterias.

> MOSKALÊV has much greater knowledge of English than he pretends or admits.
> According to our records, OSWALD was in Mexico City between those dates, and was in contact with the Cuban and Soviet Consuls.

"Saul" said he left for the U.S. in Nov 1963 but would not say how or where he crossed the border. On the evening of the 20th of Nov he was in Dallas.

# Page 177
"Saul" described how he shot President Kennedy from 2nd story window of County Records Bldg.,

# Page 178
"Saul" said that he used "limp" disguise out of bldg., and in 2 hours was out of the U.S.

McDonald said that as a professional assassin with international clientele, "Saul" had to master the art of crossing borders illegally, so that no record is kept. False passports are easiest methods.

Could "Saul" be the mystery man who boarded plane for Havana? See DIRECTOR 36054. Flight from Mexico City reportedly delayed from 1700 to 2200 hours for passenger who arrived at 2130.

# Page 182
McDonald remembers "Saul's" statement that long before the Warren Commission even existed he had been told that there was a possibility that such a bullet would be planted to tie in OSWALD's rifle positively to the shooting. 

It therefore appears that the mere existence of CE No. 399 tends to prove the accuracy of "Saul's" statement and the presence of a conspiracy.

- Page 185: McDonald believes "Saul" was telling true story. 
- CDH - I do too.

- Page 94: McDonald finds buck passing so pervasive that he cannot escape suspicion of a continued and officially backed cover-up.

- Page 199: McDonald said he thinks Hermann KIMSEY (what was true name?) was the mentor or contact for "Saul" wherever Saul worked with the Agency.  
  - Can we identify KIMSEY? Was he really working for Agency?

- Page 203: "Saul" moves from country to country, avoiding the U.S. except in extremis but keeping in touch with his contacts in Guatemala and Mexico. He calls THEM. Spends much time in Europe. Has no wife, children, or friends. Is a voracious reader.

- Page 204: "Saul" went into Westbury Hotel without a tie.

- Page 205: "Saul" had recently given up smoking (1972?) but still had nicotine stains on fingers.  
  - Does MOSKALEV smoke?

# AB MEMO NO. 194  
29 MARCH 1977  

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Chief, Latin America Division  
ATTN : Chris Hopkins  
FROM : Graphics and Authentication Division/Senior Operations Officer  
SUBJECT : Photo Comparison  
REFERENCE : DDO/LA Division Memo, dated 25 March 1977  

1. On 23 March, Chris Hopkins of Latin America Division handcarried photographs to OTS/GAD for identification comparison. These photos were examined by the undersigned and two identification experts of the Disguise and Identification Section.  

2. The results of the comparison is as follows:  

   A. Facial Shape - Close similarities, although there are slight differences which are probably due to subject's age differences.  

   B. Chin - Fair similarities; the loss of musculotone due to ageing is most apparent here.  

   C. Hair Line - Again good similarity with the natural ravages of time factored in.  

   D. Set and Proportion of Eyes and Eyebrows - Close similarities. (Comparison of eye detail is not possible due to poor photo quality)  

   E. Nose and Caliper Lines - Close similarities in the nose but the younger man has no sign of the distinctive caliper lines which extend from the nose to either side of the mouth on the known Soviet. This could be explained by loss of musculotone and/or differences in lighting.  

   F. Mouth - The shape, proportion and expression of the mouth and the whole area from the tip of the nose to the tip of the chin is perhaps the most distinctive characteristic of both subjects. Here the similarities are very close.

# SUBJECT: Photo Comparison
## PAGE -2-

G. The proportions of the head, check bones and the body style of the younger man tend to indicate he is of slavic origin.

3. The results of this type comparison are rarely absolute and are usually limited by poor photo quality or differences in viewing angle. With that understood it is our opinion the two subjects of the forementioned photo comparison could very likely be the same person. If additional photographs of the subjects, particularly if they are of better quality, are obtained, we would be happy to examine those as well.

## SUBJECT: UNIDENTIFIED KGB OFFICER  
REF: DCD CASE 57845  
CFLA-866877  

1. ON 17 MARCH 1977, A FORMER MEMBER OF THE CUBAN GENERAL DIRECTORATE OF INTELLIGENCE (DGI) WAS REQUESTED TO IDENTIFY AND PROVIDE INFORMATION ON AN UNIDENTIFIED MAN. THE FORMER DGI MEMBER IDENTIFIED THE MAN AS YURI (LINO), A KGB OFFICER, WHOM HE MET IN MOSCOW IN 1964 WHILE ATTENDING AN INTELLIGENCE COURSE. IN THAT CITY, HE SAID THAT YURI, A FLUENT ENGLISH AND SPANISH SPEAKER, WAS ACTING AS A TROUBLESHOOTER FOR THE CUBAN GROUP, ABOUT 15, ATTENDING THE COURSE.

2. THE FORMER DGI MEMBER SAID THAT THE CUBAN GROUP, ALONG WITH THE BULGARIANS, WERE QUARTERED IN THE SAME BUILDING IN MOSCOW AND THAT YURI LIVED WITH THEM. ANYTIME THAT THE CUBANS HAD A PROBLEM YURI WOULD SOLVE IT FOR THEM. HE ALSO SAID THAT YURI WAS A GOOD FRIEND OF JUAN (PSEUDO), A KGB OFFICER WHO TAUGHT THE CUBANS ABOUT THE AGENCY AND THE WEST GERMAN INTELLIGENCE APPARATUS. JUAN TOLD THE FORMER DGI MEMBER ONE DAY THAT HE HAD SERVED IN MEXICO FOR ABOUT 20 YEARS AND IN THE US CLANDESTINELY FOR ABOUT 10 YEARS. AT THE TIME JUAN WAS ABOUT 55 YEARS OLD. YURI DID NOT ATTEND CLASSES WITH THE CUBAN GROUP. HE WAS ONLY ENTRUSTED WITH THEIR WELFARE.

**REFERENCES**: 

**DATE OF INFO.**: October 1971  
**PLACE & DATE ACQ. BY SOURCE**: US/October 1971  

### THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

**SOURCE**: US biophysicist who had conversations with Yu I Moskalev and Alex Noiseev during the visit of the two Soviets to the US in October 1971.

1. In October 1971 Dr Yu I Moskalev, Institute of Biophysics, Ministry of Public Health, Moscow and Dr Alex Noisey, Central Advance Institute for Training of Physicians, Moscow, visited several US biological and biophysical research facilities. During one of these visits, it was learned from Moskalev that he is the Chairman of the USSR equivalent to the US National Council on Radiation Protection. In this position, Noisey is Moskalev's secretary.

2. Noisey was a difficult individual to figure out. He stated that his training is in health physics and that his job in the USSR is to be informed at all times of the status of US health physics and radiation protection programs. He said that he reads the US journal "Health Physics" regularly as well as other Western radiation research journals. Although in discussions with Noisey he appeared to be technically competent, he kept very close to Moskalev and rarely let him out of his sight. If Noisey is Moskalev's "guardian" (as he appeared to be) he let his guard down during a cocktail party hosted by Dr David H Taylor, Department of Biophysics, Institute of Cancer Research, Belmont, UK. During the course of the evening Noisey consumed countless gin and tonics until he could barely articulate. Moskalev, on the other hand, sipped one or two drinks all evening.

3. Moskalev was a very adept diplomat. He finds it easy and convenient to adopt his conversation to whatever kind of group he is with. He talked at considerable length about the role of women in the Soviet economy and mentioned that his own wife is a pathologist. He was always much freer in his conversation when Noisey was out of hearing.

4. In terms of his professional work, Moskalev stated that he has a program in the USSR of exposing dogs to various doses of radiation to learn the biomedical effects of radiation. It is a program quite similar to that at the Lovelace Foundation in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The major difference being that whereas the Lovelace inhalation experiments involve only the beagle dogs, the Soviets do not use a controlled breed, but rather use mongrels. Moskalev's budget, which

he implied was sufficient, comes from the Soviet Ministry of Health.  
The actual Soviet work with the dogs is virtually parallel that in  
the US. It involves studying the low level effects of radiation  
from inhaled or injected materials.

5. Moskalev's work appears to be very good as far as it has gone.  
But he has only worked with nitrates and chlorides of plutonium,  
not with plutonium oxide. Oxides (solid components) should be of  
interest to anyone working in this field because the chemical forms  
of plutonium are quite useful to know about when doing accident type  
studies — to understand plutonium metals it is essential to know  
about plutonium oxide. Whether the Soviets are working only with  
solutions rather than oxides is not known. It is always possible,  
of course, that Soviet work with plutonium oxides is classified.

## Participation in Symposium and Transuranium Registry Meeting

Five contributed papers and one invited paper by USSR scientists were included on the symposium program and were presented by Drs. Moskalev and Moiseev. These included:

1. **Yu. I. Moskalev.** Plutonium-239: Problems of Its Biological Effect (Invited).
   
2. **L. A. Buldakovi, Z. I. Kalmykova, A. P. Nifatov, V. N. Doshchenko, I. A. Tseveleva, G. S. Mushkacheva, N. P. Kudashteva, V. H. Pesternikov, V. I. Matveev, A. G. Surina, and V. N. Karjova.** Metabolism and Biological Effects of Inhaled 241Am and 239Pu in Dogs.

3. **N. A. Koshurnikov, V. P. Aristov, V. K. Lemberg, G. S. Mushkacheva, M. G. Popilyko, and I. A. Tseveleva.** As to Mechanism of Development of Plutonium Pneumonitis.

4. **T. I. Levidik, V. K. Lemberg, L. A. Buldakovi, E. R. Lyubchanskii, and V. H. Pesternikov.** As to Biological Effectiveness of Neptunium-237.

5. **E. P. Ovcharenko.** An Experimental Evaluation of the Effects of Transuranic Elements on Reproductive Ability.

The two visitors presented the Soviet papers in English (Dr. Moiseev speaks English quite well) and participated in the discussions of other papers. The visitors were already acquainted with many attending the Symposium so informal discussions were very common and apparently productive. Representatives from all major U.S. laboratories working on the transuranium elements and from the Atomic Energy Commission were able to meet with the Soviet visitors. The visitors related current status of their studies on biological effects of plutonium in their formal presentations and in their discussions. Their manuscripts have been received and will be published in the Symposium proceedings. During the week, they met with Dr. R. C. Thompson, Symposium Co-chairman, to discuss editing of their manuscripts.

## Visit to Life Sciences Laboratory

On October 1, Drs. Moskalev and Moiseev were escorted to the 331 Building by W. J. Bair. Discussions with the staff occurred during the day in the conference room with visits to various laboratory facilities occurring as necessary.

Dr. J. F. Park - Past, present, and future experiments on the biological effects of inhaled plutonium in laboratory animals; therapeutic removal of inhaled plutonium, and USSR recommendations to the ICRP to lower plutonium MPC's were discussed. These Soviet scientists have completed more work on the biological effects of inhaled plutonium in animals than any other research group except our own laboratory. The interchange of experimental methods, results, and concepts was valuable for planning our future research and evaluating the results of past and present research. Since they have reported biological effects of inhaled plutonium in experimental animals at extremely low exposure levels and recommended to the ICRP that limits of exposure should be lowered, the opportunity to understand and evaluate their experimental results, interpretation, and logic in making their recommendations was very useful.

Dr. V. H. Smith - Drs. Moiseev and Moskalev were reasonably well acquainted with the field of therapy for plutonium poisoning but not intimately in terms of details or recent Soviet literature; the former because his field was more on the ecological side, and the latter because he has concentrated on radiation effects and ceased active work on removal about ten years ago. Dr. Moskalev was interested in our plans to test phosphorothioic acids as removal agents and mentioned his own work on the removal of 144Ce with DTPA as an example of the type of treatment. He stated DTPA was critical to humans in the USSR, not by inhalation, and that Zn-DTPA was now used or being experimented with. The latter is difficult to believe due to his former close relationship with Dr. Catsche. He was not satisfied with the cloak of side effects of multiple DTPA treatments and said that some problems with bone in long-term experiments could be due to DTPA but he wasn't aware of the details. Answers to questions about other treatments than DTPA, experience in treating humans, and future plans were not obtained because presumably this was not a primary research concern of Dr. Moskalev although he did state there was considerable research effort in this field.

Dr. C. L. Sanders discussed our low-level inhaled 238PuO2 studies (life-span), metabolism of plutonium and cellular interaction with PuO2 particles. The Russians were particularly informative in describing their low-level life span studies with 239Pu. It was learned that Dr. Moiseev is primarily a radioecologist who worked in Siberia and is familiar with oil pipe lines and associated ecological problems such as arctic and lake pollution problems.

Dr. J. E. Ballou discussed their studies with soluble plutonium compounds, comparative metabolism and effects of DTPA, and our americium, plutonium, and cerium work. Dr. Moskalev had tried inhaled EDTA therapy many years ago to no avail. He was interested in our work with age effects on gut absorption and wanted to know why the very young absorb more plutonium. He agreed there is prolonged gut transit time and different intestinal morphology in

## Other Activities
During the week, in addition to participating in the Symposium social functions, they were guests in the homes of Dr. W. H. Eutz, Director, Health and Safety Division, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Richland, Drs. W. J. Pair and C. L. Sanders. These occasions were enjoyable for the horses and, apparently, for the visitors. Dr. Moiseev is an excellent chess player and very patiently played chess with both adults and children. Dr. Moiseev was interested in current fashions and consumer products. Mrs. Bair gave him the current Sears and Roebuck Christmas catalog as an example of consumer products. He was familiar with the mail order concept but we could not determine for certain that it is common in the USSR. Both Drs. Moiseev and Moisakaley have dachas near Moscow which indicate they are well up the status ladder in USSR science, but it was also obvious that Dr. Moisakaley's dacha is a level above Dr. Moiseev's.

The visitors also expressed interest in our standard of living. The visits to our homes seemed to dispel some doubts they might have had about our standard of living. They seemed particularly to enjoy the opportunity to meet our children.

## Comment
All those having an opportunity to meet with our Soviet guests were impressed by their congeniality, willingness to discuss their research, interest in our family life, and the spirit of good will.

# REPORT ON VISIT OF FOREIGN SCIENTISTS, OCTOBER 4, 1971

There were four guests in the group:
- Dr. (Prof) Yuri I. Moskalev; Inst. of Biophysics, Ministry of Public Health, Moscow. 6002547
- Dr. Alexei A. Moiseev; Central Inst. for Advanced Medical Studies, Moscow
- Dr. Jean-Claude Nénot; CEA, Centre D'Études Nuclaires, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France
- Dr. R. Hasse; CEA as above.

The four visitors were not traveling together but by coincidence were participants at the same *Transuranium Biology Symposium* at Hanford during the week of Sept. 12. They were in San Francisco by chance at the same time and desired to visit Berkeley on the same day.

Mrs. Ann Low-Beer picked up the four guests in San Francisco and brought them to the Donner Laboratory where they were greeted by Dr. John Lawrence. Drs. Donald Van Dyke, James MoRae, and Howard Parker took them on a short tour of the Anger camera facility and whole-body counting and scanning equipment. The current uses and potential in medical diagnosis were discussed. Major questions concerned the use of these instruments in monitoring and assessing the extent of persons contaminated with radionuclides in industrial accidents.

Lunch was attended by Dr. Hardin Jones, the four guests, Drs. Van Dyke and Parker, and Dr. Patricia Durbin, who acted as hostess and guide through the day. Topics discussed at lunch were centered about the Transuranium symposium. The efficacy of two new techniques to remove lung contamination by alpha-emitting isotopes was considered. The two techniques are lung lavage and aerosolized chelating agents, particularly DTPA.

A tour of Bldg. 74 followed lunch. Three of the visitors are biologists—Drs. Moskalev and Nénot are physicians, and Dr. Masse is a veterinarian—and dealt with animal experiments or the interpretation of the results of animal experiments. They were much interested in how one achieved and managed a “biologically clean” rodent colony, in the minimum maintenance rabbit rooms, and the cage-washing facilities. There was some discussion about the 90-Sr-injected monkeys, their exposure levels, years of follow-up, and the essential absence of biological effects at the dose levels in the study.

A two-hour general discussion between and among the four guests and Dr. Durbin followed the building tour. The chief topics discussed were how to explain the observed differences in the metabolism of the transuranic elements among species. The usefulness and verifiability of models of human Pu metabolism were considered at great length. New areas of research in internal emitters problems were considered including the influence of age on local dose and ultimate biological end-points; the usefulness of common experiments with various species particularly those with known variations in iron metabolism, bone formation rates and liver function.

Dr. Durbin proposed a collaborative effort with two of Dr. Moskalev's colleagues. They have collected data on human skeleton weights, but now do not have the time or interest to write up their material. Dr. Durbin has collected data of the 19th century and early 20th century human bone weight data and would like to add the modern Russian material to the set. Dr. Moskalev agreed to propose a joint article with his colleagues looking towards publication in an international journal. He assured that the original data would be forwarded in any case as soon as it could be copied.

In the late afternoon the visitors toured (briefly) the Bevatron guided by Ralph Thomas; the californium separation facility guided by Francis McCarthy; and the H-lac guided by Al Chihos. Dr. Moiseev, who is a physicist, was very much intrigued by the proposal to make an advanced scientific instrument by joining the Bevatron and the H-lac. Dr. Moskalev was not interested in how the machines worked; "physics was not his field," but said what he as a biologist might do in the nature of radiobiology experiments with such machines.

Dr. Moskalev regretted that it had not been possible to visit with Dr. Tobias. (We could probably have fit in a few minutes or made arrangements for the following day, but I had run them ragged with sight-seeing the day before. Monday was very full, and frankly they were exhausted and needed rest, pwd). They would also have liked to visit the Medical Services group. Mrs. Low-Beer tried to fill them in on the duties and routine of that group.

Comments on money, budgets, problems of communication, demands on time, such as committees, etc. ran through all of the conversations. Dr. Nenot and Dr. Moskalev spoke English and understood it well. Dr. Masse understood more English than they could speak. All four are chiefly occupied with radiation protection and especially with problems raised by internal emitters. Dr. Moskalev is his country's representative on the ICRP internal dose committee. They all forgive the development of nuclear power in their countries at a fast pace. This obviously includes, as they were careful to point out, Pu fast breeders, hence the overriding interests in Pu and its transposition contaminants.

The Russian visitors will be guests of the AEC Division of Biology and Medicine in Washington. (I feel certain we will receive good marks as hosts and as scientists, pwd).

One further point needs to be added. Although nuclear medicine is not a current specialty in either country, and the use of nuclear medical techniques, especially as diagnostic tools, is very limited, the two physicians indicated that they personally were much interested, and there was a definite trend in both countries towards more and more use of such tools. "It is coming", they said.

## SUBJECT: Dr. Y. I. Moskalev, Institute of Biophysics, Moscow/Professional Interests/Personal Characteristics/Foreign Travel

---

1. In September 1970, Dr. Yuri Ivanovich Moskalev visited a US facility devoted to research in the field of nuclear medicine. Dr. Moskalev was born on 23 July 1920 in Igumnovo, USSR, which is near Kalinin. In 1922 his family moved to Leningrad. He has lived in Moscow since 1948. In 1958 he became the head of a division comprised of approximately 30 people at the Institute of Biophysics, Soviet Ministry of Public Health, Moscow. He is the best known investigator of the metabolism and toxicity of radioelements in the Soviet Union and has published a number of papers and reviews on this subject. During his visit, he outlined his as yet unpublished experiment on skin carcinogenesis in rats (dosage administered to the body surface by Sr90 - Y90 plaques on the sides of the cage) and reported two percent tumors of the skin and some urinary tumors after a 245 rad exposure. It is obvious that he is a careful and trustworthy worker.

2. Moskalev is conversant with English but not fluent, and has some difficulty in finding the correct English words; however, with a little patience, scientific communication is very satisfactory. He is genial, frank, and possesses a good sense of humor. He prefers Leningrad to Moscow, considering the former to be a more traditional and cultured city. His chief recreational diversion is his dacha, near Moscow, to which he sometimes travels by skis in winter (a distance of approximately 20 kilometers).

3. Dr. Moskalev has visited the United States on two previous occasions; once attending the Sun Valley Symposium in 1967 and again for the Annual Stanford Biology Symposium in 1969. He has traveled to other places outside the Soviet Union and was present at a meeting sponsored by the IAEA in Vienna in 1964.

## SUBJECT
Second International Congress on Radiation Protection/Unimpressive Soviet Contribution/Lafuma's Work With DTPA at Fontenay-aux-Roses/General Interest in Plutonium Protection

## DATE OF INFO.
May 1970

## PLACE & DATE ACQ. BY SOURCE
Brighton/Fontenay-aux-Roses - May 1970

> **THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION**

SOURCE: US citizen, radiation physicist who attended the Second International Congress on Radiation Protection, Brighton, UK, 3-8 May 70.

1. The Soviet delegation to the Second International Congress on Radiation Protection arrived several days late. As a consequence, the only presentation from the USSR personally attended was a paper entitled, "Disorder in Embryonal Development of Rats after Injection of 131," by A. M. Lyaginskaya. Since the same experiment has been conducted on the human embryo, there was really nothing new or even interesting in Lyaginskaya's presentation.

2. A Soviet delegate, who was very busy asking many questions at virtually every session personally attended, was Yuriy I. Moskalev. Moskalev is a well-known scientist in the fields of radiobiology and radiotoxicity. He asked all of his questions through an interpreter, but when answers were given in English, he always seemed to understand without benefit of his interpreter. Moskalev indicated to us attendees that the USSR was finally planning to request membership in the International Radiation Protection Association (IRPA).

3. The most interesting work presented at the meeting from a personal point of view was that of Professor J. Lafuma, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France. He is charged with the responsibility of setting the plutonium protection standards and removal techniques after exposure to plutonium for all of France. Lafuma's most impressive work involves the success he has had in removing copious amounts of plutonium and other transuranium products from humans using DTPA.

4. Lafuma explained that from his point of view he was concerned with only two primary aspects of human contact with plutonium, inhalation and wounds. His studies have shown, of course, that the earlier treatment is begun the better the results; but also he has found it easier to decontaminate an area of the body exposed to plutonium through contact or a wound than to remove it from the lungs. Lafuma has used intravenous injection exclusively for the treatment of wounds and finds that a very significant amount of the transuranium particles are discharged from the body in urine. For the treatment of inhaled particles, Lafuma has used both DTPA aerosols and injection. He finds his results from injection are better than the use of aerosols, even in lung decontamination.

### SOURCE  
US citizen; a professor and researcher in radiation biology at a US university.  
[This report was prepared for submission to the US Atomic Energy Commission and is disseminated in accordance with DCID/2.3.]

1. A US radiation biology researcher attended both the Biology and Ecology of Polonium and Radiocalc Conference, Sutton, UK, 30 April - 1 May 1970, and the Second Congress of the International Radiation Protection Association, Brighton, UK, 3-8 May 1970.

2. The nature of the Sutton meeting was such that few significant scientific positions were taken; however, in general, the quality of the panels was very high. The scheduled Soviet participants, P Ramzayev and FNUU [Moskalyev], were presumably not permitted by the USSR to attend; P Panov (Yugoslavia) was in the US, and B Djuric (Yugoslavia) did not attend for unknown reasons. The countries represented were UK (26), Italy (5), France (1), Sweden (2), Poland (1), South Africa (1), and the US (7).

3. To the extent that the proper “half-life for lead in man” was discussed, the consensus appeared to be that (a) the loss rate can not be reported as a single exponential; (b) the presently available data on baboons and beagle dogs does not extend for a sufficient period of time to provide a measure of the “last slow rate loss constant”; (c) it is likely that lead and radium loss rates will differ because of the selective reutilization of Pb in bone. D Bartlrop (UK) and US researchers have been performing experiments which indicate that lead is not bound by red cell membranes, but at sites in the cell interior.

4. C R Hill (UK) provided a useful summary of the contribution of polonium to human radiation dose. It is stipulated that the distribution of polonium will depend on whether it is administered as polonium per se or is allowed to grow in an animal as the daughter of an ingested parent. This is a significant consideration to biological researchers engaged in dose calculation work.

5. Twenty-nine countries and five international bodies were represented at the Second Congress of the International Radiation Protection Association. W G Marley (UK) was the congress president and II J Dinstur (UK) was the secretary of the scientific program committee. The congress shared the common problems and advantages of similar large meetings. Concurrent sessions inevitably brought about some conflicts in important papers; discussion was generally absent or quite limited, and there was the usual number of papers given in “broken” English by foreign scientists.

**SOURCE:** US citizen, an active researcher in the field of long-range effects of radio nuclides.

1. I was quite surprised when I arrived in Sun Valley, Idaho, to participate in the International Symposium on Delayed Effects of Bone Seeking Radio Nuclides to find that Dr. Yuriy I. Moskalev of the Institute of Physics had arrived two days earlier. Moskalev had traveled alone to Sun Valley and apparently was able to use his knowledge of the English language to get along on his own. However, he complained to the chairman of the conference that he did not know enough English to read his paper which also required condensation because it was too long for the time allowed. A colleague who had known Moskalev from earlier meetings said Moskalev's knowledge of English improved greatly after a few drinks. However, during this conference, he did not drink at all. He did mention, however, that he had written the English version of the paper he presented himself and said he could read and write English quite well but was deficient in the spoken language.

2. Moskalev's paper concerned the results of a series of experiments utilizing an unusually large number of rats and mice. The numbers used were far in excess of those that would be used in a western laboratory. These figures were undoubtedly meant to impress his western associates. The data the presenter was primarily on Strontium 90. His findings indicated that Strontium 90 was much more toxic than had been reported anywhere in western literature and that it was more carcinogenic than has been previously reported. His technique was almost exclusively injections of radio nuclides. The control he had on his animals was not explained, but very likely was very poor. He claims to have been able to induce cancer in laboratory animals at permissible exposure levels for atomic workers in the US. The animals were not examined for radioactivity, only for the existence of cancer. A respected scientist with much more experience than Moskalev flatly stated, in private, that he did not believe Moskalev's findings. Moskalev did not ask questions during the question periods. However, he did talk privately to several scientific reporters after their presentations.

3. Dr. Heinz Spies' West Germany reported on the results of injections of Radium 224 made during World War II in a wide section of the population in Germany. At that time, there was a mistaken belief that Radium 224 had a very beneficial effect on a person's health. He reported on 242 cases in which all types of cancer were appearing. The results of...

on dog populations in this country. Moskalev made an attempt to make some propaganda of this report by asking in a small group, "Why did you do this?" almost accusing Spiez of doing it himself.

4. Moskalev left the conference a little upset. It was suggested that he might visit a US laboratory en route home, and considerable time was expended to arrange this visit. However, he apparently took a different route and made no effort to tell anyone of his plans, and he did not visit the laboratory. He took copious notes on all papers, which indicated he was understanding what was going on. He took many pictures with a 35mm camera. From the questions he did ask in private, it was obvious that he understood English well.

5. I understand a Polish scientist had been invited to the conference. However, when his paper was submitted, the reviewer criticized it quite severely and suggested changes. As a result, the Polish scientist apparently decided not to attend the conference.

6. Three French scientists asked to be invited when the symposium was first announced. They even gave titles to their papers and the papers were put on the program. However, they later withdrew and no French scientists attended the meeting.

**DATE OF INFO:** Sept 67  
**PLACE & DATE ACQ:** --- Sept '67  
**SOURCE:** US citizen; research scientist.  

[This report was developed by an Army representative assigned to the office of preparation.]

1. I attended the Second International Symposium on "Delayed Effects of Bone Seeking Radionuclides", Sun Valley, Idaho 12-14 Sept 67.

2. An interesting paper was presented by Yuri I Moskalev, USSR on "Some Late Effects of Radionuclide Damage". Dr. Moskalev was not expected at the meeting and he came alone, arriving two days early. He had furnished no brief and it was a surprise to hear his paper.

3. I was unaware that research such as he presented was being done in the USSR. His demonstration was a good piece of scientific work, that is, his procedures and results in pathological consequences of radioisotopes fit reasonably well with our procedures and results in the US. He did not present anything new in his paper, and it must certainly reveal that they are a few years behind the US in biology and radioisotope studies and applications. They are apparently still testing the copy of radio elements, which we have already established and accept, knowing the effects and using them accordingly. In other words; we are through with his reported work, feeling that it is completed; apparently they are not. Else, they don't yet know the toxicly boundaries, are still experimenting along those lines, or are experimenting to see how much more they can learn. But his paper reveals remarkable.

4. Dr. Moskalev understands English reasonably well, but speaks it less well. Therefore, his appearance alone at the conference was even more unusual.

5. I understand that Dr. Moskalev became very interested in visiting a certain US facility researching in his field of interest and pursued arrangements to visit there. His time schedule permitted the visit and permission to visit the facility was obtained for him from the facility and the US governmental clearances were also obtained. However, after all this was done, he "backed out", going to great extent to give the.

reason that the itinerary change was too much trouble for the US persons and authorities concerned, notwithstanding the fact that all change arrangements had already been completed, which facts he well knew. From the USSR viewpoint, he stated that no objections would exist, but I doubt that this was true. He was in Sun Valley for four days, immediately after the conference he went to Salt Lake City, and then on to Montreal, Canada. His schedule allowed for several days in Canada, but he stated that he was leaving Montreal immediately for Moscow.

**SOURCE:**  
**SOURCE A.** US citizen, radiologist at US university.

**SOURCE B.** US citizen, biologist at US university.

#### SOURCE A:
1. About one third of the Soviets expected at the **Third International Congress of Radiation Research** put in an appearance. The papers heard were disappointing. In my opinion the Soviets are confining themselves to a narrow range of interests in their radiation research. In Session 1, which was concerned with [*unclear text about*] injected radioisotopes, a paper written by Y. I. Moskalev and Y. Streletskov of the Institute of Biophysics of the Ministry of Public Health, USSR, did not impress me. A very poor reading marked the presentation of the paper prepared by Tumanov of the Gamaleya Institute for Epidemiology and Microbiology, Academy of Medical Sciences of the USSR. The paper was given in a hurried and garbled fashion by a person who obviously was not a scientist. After the session ended, I talked to Tumanov regarding her radiation experiments with monkeys. A woman about 45 years of age, Tumanov had no English but spoke excellent French. She was quite enthusiastic about her work which I in turn considered commonplace.

2. It appears to me that the Soviets have a strong tendency toward experiments that enable them to study radiation effects on large animals. They do not seem interested in radiation response — the effect on tissue; on the other hand, they concern themselves with metabolic effects, which are important because they are related to the ability to suppress immunity mechanisms. They stress immunology and transplants.

#### SOURCE B:
3. Session 8, which was devoted to the discussion of radiation effects on cells, had but one Soviet paper. This was presented by J. I. Kerkis of the Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Siberian Department of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, Novosibirsk. It was a poor paper.

4. The meeting gave me an opportunity to renew my acquaintance with David Shugar of the Warsaw Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of Poland. Though a highly competent scientist and a dedicated Communist, Shugar seems to be short of funds. The organizing committee of the Congress sent him money to insure his presence at Cortina d'Ampezzo. He and his wife drove by automobile from Poland to Italy. Shugar introduced me to one of his students - K I Wierczowski. In performing the introduction Shugar declared the young man was highly capable and had a brilliant future.

5. The International Committee of Photobiology had an executive committee meeting at Cortina d'Ampezzo. It was decided to hold a photobiology symposium in the late summer of 1967 on the Island of Hvar, Yugoslavia. The symposium will emphasize photosynthesis. The general plan calls for participation by about 100 scientists, with emphasis being placed on invitations to the younger scientists in the Sov Bloc. The chief organizer of the forthcoming symposium is Maria Draulić, Laboratory of Cellular Biochemistry, Institute "Rudjer Bosković", Belgrade.

> THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

**SOURCE:** Three US citizens. Radiobiologists at a major US radiobiological research center.

Sources participated in IAEA Symposium on Neutron Irradiations, Brookhaven, Long Island, New York.  
*Source:*

1. **Q.** Did Symposium contributions include significant advancements in research on controlled thermonuclear reactions that may be useful in determining the feasibility of initiating uncontrolled thermonuclear reactions solely without the use of fissionable materials which would produce large amounts of energy, on the order of one kiloton or greater?  
   **A.** To the best of my knowledge there was no formal discussion of any nuclear reactions, as such. The great majority of the material presented had to do with biological effects, and the physicists at the Symposium were using high energy machines largely to produce the radiation that would be comparable to solar flare radiation.

2. **Q.** Was anything presented on effects of space radiation on the human body?  
   **A.** I can recall no Soviet references to the Vostok flights. The two Soviet speakers confined their references to purely laboratory observations. There was a number of US papers, and as I recall one from France, oriented to space flight conditions, however.

3. **Q.** Were there results in the use of drugs in radiation protection?  
   **A.** I do not recall anyone's discussing drugs—Soviet or other. And I think that although research in drugs is continuing many radiobiologists are not very optimistic about their value. This is something many of us have reservations about.

4. **Q.** Was anything presented on the characteristics of a bio-element used for space radiation detection including the number required for an extended space probe and the method of transmitting information?  
   **A.** I do not recall any discussion of this by anybody. Practically everyone was talking about physical measurements.

## Is there anything on biological indicators at low ranges of radiation doses?

### 1.
This is something on which I can speak somewhat as an expert. Although people may claim to have this, I do not think anyone has it, including the Soviets. One can find biological criteria at low doses, but they have meaning beyond the limited experiment is the big question, you see.

### 2.
The results presented on cosmic and Van Allen belt radiation effects on organisms in such areas as lethal, metabolic, developmental and reproductive...

### 3.
What conclusions are presented on determining the relative biologic effectiveness factor of biologic material when exposed to radiation from nuclear testing?
In, I can speak with some certitude. There is no conclusion about the relative biological effect of this factor. People will argue about it. 

#### 4.
There is no conclusion. The Soviets had some things to say about it; they were thoroughly confused about their position. There are two ways of thinking about the RBE factor. One is from the viewpoint of theoretical effectiveness, and this becomes one of the parameters of experiment. The second is the question of an empirical number that one can use in handling questions of judgment about radiation exposure in man. With regard to the question of judgment, I think that most biologists would agree that we do not have any reliable and valuable RBE factors. We have numbers that represent what we might be afraid of, more than anything else.

### 5.
Did the Soviets say anything bearing on physical measurements of radiation in space in terms of relative biological effectiveness factor and implications for future manned space flights?

One of the Soviet delegates, [Yu. I. Moskalev], was a frequent commentator on these environments and he made a practice of demonstrating the reports with those people with respect to radiation lethality. His comment was to consider that the studies of radiation lethality done usually in small animals were not to the point, were not germane to problems in the human case, and that to be useful these studies should be done in animals closer to man.

### 6.
What is your critique of his argument?

Well, a mass of work has been done with the smaller animals in various laboratories and we are beginning to get certain generalities about the nature of radiation injury, or at least certain kinds of radiation injury, and therefore I think it is worthwhile to pursue it. As you might imagine, I presented a paper on radiation lethality and was among those whose work Moskalev objected.

### 7.
Do you think Moskalev's objections were motivated from anything more than a genuine scientific position?

Who can say? In their published work the Soviets show a lot of attention to effects in the central nervous system—they are very interested in this and we people have tended to ignore this area. So conceivably Moskalev is oriented to CNS work and physiological functions, I do not know. But quite a lot of the Soviet work has a different orientation from western work—at least their published stuff.

24. Moskalev, both from the papers he gave and his questions and comments, indicated that he was very sharp, very advanced in his knowledge of the biological effects of radiation, particularly with respect to distinguishing among the effects of various energies of neutrons and the techniques for measuring these energies. I think it may be safely assumed that the Russians are using very advanced methods for detecting and measuring the various energies of neutrons—the dosimetry of neutrons. In the biological effect, I think they are way behind us. But they are much involved in the potentials of neutron irradiation and their objectives are, I am sure, the effects of space radiation on human beings.

25. Actually, [V P] Afanas'yev, who is a physicist, was even more sophisticated than Moskalev. Afanas'yev's paper was entitled "Production and Investigation of Dose Fields for Irradiation of Experimental Animals with Protons of High Energy". His paper showed that both their production of high energy protons in the laboratory and the measurements of these protons with respect to animal work is sophisticated. They are advanced in this. I think this is the distinction to be made: they are more advanced in the technology of producing high energy radiations and the measurement of these than they are in biological effects of radiation.

26. **Q:** Was anything reported on effects of radiation, on non-regenerative tissues such as the brain?

   **A:** The Russians are very much involved in CNS effects of radiation, but they presented no data at the Symposium. The paper that Moskalev gave was a survey of Russian research work on biological action of neutrons and isotopes. It covered maybe twenty different pieces of work with only a few sentences for each. It presented no new data and nothing on the CNS as I recall. Afanas'yev's paper, on the other hand, presented new data on the production of dose fields with high energy protons.

27. **Q:** It gives the impression that whereas Russians' work is mechanistic and quite indistinguishable from ours in that respect, Russian biology is impregnated with philosophy. Moskalev, for example, spoke of how the body "adapts" to radiation in the sense that a single animal adapts. Most biologists will reserve this word to changes in a species over a very long period. I suppose you could consider wound healing as adaptation in a sense. But Western biology seems certain events occurring in an organism as the consequence of a wound which can be described without resort to notions of teleological adaptation. This philosophical tendency has been a damaging element in Russian biology, I believe.

28. **Q:** Were there results in the use of drugs in radiation protection?

   **A:** I can recall nothing on protective drugs from anybody. There was here and there a reporting of drugs used to enhance the effect of radiation with respect to tumor treatment.

29. **Q:** Has anything presented on the characteristics of a bio-element used for space radiation detection including the number required for an extended space probe and the method of transmitting information?

   **A:** I am afraid I do not understand the question.

30. **Q:** Was there anything on biological indicators at low ranges of radiation doses?

   **A:** There is a tremendous amount of interest in such indicators everywhere. Moskalev's presentations did not say anything specific except that the Russians are working on long-term effects of small doses of radiation.

mostly as regards tumors. So they are interested in carcinogenesis and in fact Moskalev asked me a question following my paper on carcinogenesis, so presumably they are not concerned with these. 

31. People from other countries, and particularly the U.S., reported work having to do with low dose effects and reliable biological indicators for low ranges of dose using the chromosome aberration methods in human cells. But the Russians had nothing to say about this particular thing and seem not to be working on it as yet.

---

34. Q. In your opinion, what is the level of accomplishment, worldwide, in this matter of getting reliable indicators of biological damage?  
   A. As far as I know, the most sensitive and reliable biological index for damage at low dose rates involves the study of chromosome abnormalities. The approach was developed in the US and is being used extensively here and in England, and other countries are taking it up. Moreover, I think that in radiobiology in general, in almost any question you could ask, the west and particularly the US and England are very much in the forefront. From what I know of Russian radiobiology from translations and literature, the Russians are years behind us, but I exclude their related physical work from this judgment.

33. Q. Was there reporting from the Soviets on types of radiation detection equipment used in the Vostok flights? Did they report findings on the relative biological effectiveness factor values for neutrons, protons and cosmic ray attenuations?  
   A. Well, again, there was no specific mention of this, but the interest in the relative biological effectiveness factor for neutrons and cosmic radiation was a major concern of the whole Symposium; the attempt to elucidate the RBE factor and particularly the problem with respect to large animals, like humans, where in the case of neutrons you have a change in the type of radiation in the interior of the animal. You do not have this change with x- gamma rays, but you do have it with fast neutrons.

34. Q. How is this neutron change manifested in large animals?  
   A. The neutrons become moderated. As they proceed through the tissue, the hydrogen in the tissue reacts with the neutrons and there is a change in the energies taken up. At some point, you have gammas. So, the first few layers of hydrogenous material on the outside of the animal tend to change the dose, and in the interior, where the important effects occur, you do not know what the dose is. We talk about mid-line doses, average doses, but the actual dose in the cells of the bone marrow or the gut, we do not know yet. This is one of the problems of the RBE and a very big one.

35. [A G] Searle of Harwell reported genetic effects of low dose rate neutrons in mice finding that there were as many if not more mutations with low dose rate neutrons than with high dose rate neutrons. His work is the first direct evidence of the cumulative effect of a prolonged, or fractionated, low dose of neutrons, 10% dose of neutrons. You do not have such an effect with x- or gamma rays. If you prolong the dose with these, the effect will be very much less than it would be if you gave the same total dose in a single fast pulse.

36. Q. The neutron dose given gradually might have an even more damaging effect than if given all at once, is that it?  
   A. Yes, at least. At least, but the matter is still delicate, for Searle's experiment was with mice and the question remains whether neutrons, as such, will ...

> *gat into cells in the interior of a large animal, such as a human being, or will be moderated and changed into gamma rays. The neutron RBE for mortality in dogs, as reported from my laboratory and Brookhaven, is around 1. For small animals like mice, it is more like three or four. So there is this discrepancy, and it may be promising for large animal research. Harwell, my laboratory, and the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago are now setting up to apply low dose rate neutrons in sheep. This will be new work and should have important results.*

37. **Q.** Were results presented on cosmic and Van Allen belt radiation effects on test organisms in such areas as lethal, metabolic, developmental and genetic?  
   **A.** There was nothing on this as far as I know, except for a paper from the Donner Laboratory people at the University of California, Berkeley entitled "Some Biological Effects of 730 MeV Protons". This may simulate the kind of radiation that occurs in space and this is why they are playing around with it, you see.

38. **Q.** Were conclusions presented on determining the relative biologic effectiveness factor of biologic material when exposed to radiation from nuclear testing?  
   **A.** Well, this kind of interest is implied in work with neutrons. With neutrons there is this question of RBE and it was one of the major points of discussion at the Symposium.

39. **Q.** Did the Soviets say anything bearing on physical measurements of radiation in space in terms of relative biological effectiveness factor and implications for future manned space flights?  
   **A.** All I can say is that it is logical to suppose that this is what they are after: good physical measurements of radiation of a type that might be anticipated in space.

40. **Q.** Was there anything said on mapping and profiles for space radiation?  
   **A.** There was nothing on this.

41. **Q.** What interest have the Soviets shown in development and testing of nuclear power sources for thermionic power generators? Are the Soviets now applying such generators?  
   **A.** There was nothing on this.

42. **Q.** Did the Soviets report progress in radiation resistant materials and components for application to long space flight electronic equipment?  
   **A.** This Symposium was all biological, so there was nothing on this.

43. **Q.** Was there anything from the Soviets on methods of radiation shielding?  
   **A.** It was there by implication. The fact that they were talking about the investigation of dose fields, the radiation of experimental animals with protons of high energy, implies that they would be using some kind of shielding to get the animal exposed.

44. **Q.** This contribution would have been in Afanas'yev's paper "Production and Investigation of Dose Fields for Irradiation of Experimental Animals with Protons of High Energy"?  
   **A.** Yes.

1. **The hypothesis** in *Radiological Health and Safety in Nuclear Materials* 

The August meeting in Vienna, from Aug 12-14, brought together the medical multi-disciplinary groups concerned with the health and safety of people exposed to uranium materials in mining and milling and the overall problem of public health from the waste materials in this industry. To this end, it was concluded on the necessity of understanding the work within each of these disciplines in order to help define the exposure risks associated with nuclear and chemical materials encompassed in these industries.

# Observations on an Unusual New Route

**1**. Observation of an unusual new route of exposure to uranium as the result of inhalation. History shows a mixture of the effects of lung cancers, and also removed from such exposures that created the relationship to a type of urinary uranium excretion form and its retention. The uranium analyses in the lung were concerned with cancer. It also allegedly caused a detrimental condition reflected in their dogs but no pathological changes were seen in the previous studies on autopsy. They did find chloride deposits in pulmonary structures, reminiscent in the dogs, and lauding the highest percent of “andal” in today’s air systems containing a carcinogenic form of the lung. Various changes in the lungs and radon exposures in animals cut any clinical pathology. 

This shows a dire consequence of lung damage than either silica or radon alone. The USSS reported on the body system with numerous unshielded radioisotopes with such elemental signs. The reported changes in the lungs, one year previous, and generally we know so little about the citizens.

5. J Leflun from France reported finding radon attached by a cross blood circular in a clever dog inhaling radon. Radon daughters were present in the dogs. The Yugoslavs reported concerning the immediate radon daughter attached. Here the environment stressed the importance of measurement’s as change in the environment to calculate radon in a lung. In their press, they found a high lung result of radon daughters and in the first daughters, it was not really very concerning there.

6. J C Gilliland of the US mentioned the special disqualification of radon daughters in uranium, or for determining and time-weighted exposure. For 95% confidence, we did not warn a frequency of samples. We detected no new ideas in terms of monitoring the concentrations. 

7. E K Hybart of the US has a major direction on the techniques for measuring and sizing radioactive particles stating that the particles adjusting density of radioactive substances are closely important in evaluating biological effects. 

Management of wastes appears to be a unique position for the areas in which wastes occur. No general management of wastes was processed.

![Description of what the image shows](image)  
The image is a document report detailing various aspects of radiological health and safety related to uranium mining and milling, including discussions and references from various laboratories and organizations. It contains a header, date, and multiple sections with numbered items discussing specific topics.

1. In late August 1963, I attended the Symposium on Radiological Health and Safety, held in Vienna 25-31 August under auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency; the International Labor Office, and the World Health Organization. In early September 1963, I visited related laboratories as follows: (1) Laboratoires du Centre D'Étude Nucléaire, Bel, Belgium; (2) Division of Radiobiology, Research Institute of National Defense, Stockholm, Sweden, and (3) Forsvaretts Forenningsanstalt, Research Institute of National Defense, Stockholm, Sweden.

2. Due to a misunderstanding in the 1963, the topics covered by the report were not known sufficiently in advance; for Soviet scientists to contribute papers or other than informal testimony. Therefore, Soviet Delegates X Tschenkov briefly discussed USSR uranium mining health practices which included: (1) materials; (2) personal protective devices; such as respiratory masks and filters; and (3) preventive health or prophylactic procedures include assignment of mine workers to a sanitarium for one month each year. Kidney damage or other pathology, apparently, has been seen as a result of uranium mining activities in the USSR. There was no mention of cancer due to this activity. Four papers from the USSR dealt with laboratory studies on the toxicology of mineral miners. Most Soviet studies involved intratracheal administration of the isotopes, although it was brought out that the importance of inhalation as a route of entry is being recognized. The symposium brought together a world cross-section of scientific disciplines for discussion of uranium mining and milling hazards. Details of all of this are given in my trip report which follows.

This is apparently due to the high acceptance of data published by the University of Rochester. It was pointed out that the possible contribution of radioactive dust composed of other than radon daughters was not actually evaluated in the case of the Schneeberg lung cancers because test samples were not collected. Although radon is released by crushing of ores, radon and radon daughters were not considered to be a problem in uranium mills of France because of large work areas and high ventilation rates.

Four papers from the USSR dealt with laboratory studies on the toxicology of internal emitters in general particles, early Cs137, Sr89, Sr90, Y91, Ce144, Zr95, I131, Ru106, uranium and radon. Most studies involved intratracheal administration of the isotopes, although a few inhalation studies were described. These papers were all given by Dr I N Burykina in the absence of Drs Moskalev, Sanotsky, Novikova and others. They report that 10 to 18 per cent of the inhaled radioactivity was found in the lungs of rats and dogs after exposure, and that five per cent was cleared by ciliary activity. These data are difficult to evaluate since the particle sizes of the aerosols were broadly described as being between 1 and 4 µm. Translocation of the inhaled radioisotopes was similar to that reported by others.

Biological effects were reported only for intratracheal administration of Ce144 and Ru106. They report degenerative inflammation of the lung and aplastic changes in the bone marrow accompanied by leukopenia in acute stages. In long term studies they find chronic pneumonia and degenerative and proliferative changes of the bronchial epithelium and connective tissue. They also reported reduction of bone marrow hematopoiesis and degenerative changes in the liver, kidney, etc. These occurred after deposition of 1 to 19 µCi Ce144 in rats, 0.6 to 2.6 µCi Ce144/gram of dog, and 0.4 µCi Ru106/gram of rat. No cardiovascular changes were noted, but were not specifically studied: the results of studies with uranium were similar to those reported many times, with the exception of central nervous system injury which consisted of changes in conditioned reflexes and in history and excitatory processes. Due to this and relatively high burden found in skeleton (3 to 4 per cent) they conclude that uranium toxicity is not necessarily confined to kidney damage. Kustava's paper on synergistic effects of silicosis and radon reported previously published data: Silicate rats were exposed to 8 µCi radon. The radon treated silicate rats showed more serious clinical symptoms; drop in circulating blood cells, and more extensive lung pathology than rats treated with radon or silica alone.

An excellent paper describing experimental work on the inhalation of Rn222 and its decay products was presented by Dr E Pohl from the University of Innsbruck, Austria. When Rn was inhaled in equilibrium with RaA, RaB, and RaC the concentration of daughters in lungs and other tissues were higher than when the concentrations of RaA, RaB, and RaC in the inhaled air were less than the equilibrium values. However, in the latter case the concentrations of daughter products in the lungs and other tissues were higher than would be predicted from the concentrations in the air. Further experiments are in progress to confirm and explain these results. Similar, but less extensive, studies were reported in a paper co-authored by Dr LaFuma of France and Medjidov of Yugoslavia.

1. The Symposium on Radiological Health and Safety in Nuclear Materials Mining and Milling in Vienna, 26-31 Aug 63, did not provide much new information mainly because the US is so far ahead of the other countries represented at the symposium in its studies of these subjects. The US was actually the only country which presented original material at the conference. The Soviets sent a small three or four-member delegation headed by Yuriy Ivanovich Noskalyev, a very personable and diplomatic gentleman. At the end of the conference, he voiced his dismay at all apparent insincerity, that the Soviets had misunderstood the exact point of the meeting and had presented very minor papers. 

2. All the Soviet papers were read by V S Kusneva, a woman physician who delivered them very dramatically. The most interesting Soviet claims, which we do not believe directly applicable to the causes claimed and which were not fully documented were:
   a. that uranium effects the central nervous system, i.e., causes certain changes in the Pavlovian reflexes;

> THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

**SOURCE**: US citizen, doctor of medicine.

Source conducts research in the treatment of radioactive metal poisoning and is also a clinician when such cases arise at the medical center. Source speaks German and keeps abreast of all literature on the subject of radio-active poisoning. [This report was prepared for an AMI representative assigned to the office of preparation.]

1. I participated in the World Health Organization's International Atomic Energy Agency's scientific meeting on the diagnosis and treatment of radioactive poisoning held at Vienna, Austria, 15-18 Oct 62. There were only 26 participants at this meeting; therefore, each individual is considered to have qualified in this particular field observing how they would not have been invited as a participant.

2. The two USSR doctors who were invited were Dr. J. S. Shikov and Dr. T. Tsarevich, a female doctor. They are both from the Research Institute. When the secretary was not heard from then, he contacted the permanent USSR representative of the International Atomic Energy Agency, who called Moscow to find out whether or not these two representatives would be attending. He was informed that they could not due to unforeseen circumstances. Their incident pertained to Moscalyev. He speaks only Russian. 

> Note: this is the effect of radioactive materials. 

3. Professor V. Volt, Department of Radiation Protection, Institute of Industrial Hygiene and Occupational Diseases, is listed as well-known scientist. He is tall, a man, and athletic, is in his 30’s, about 6 feet tall, speaks broken English. He has one boy aged 5; a girl aged 9. He lives in Prague. He publishes an annual report of proceedings at his institute, which I observe. He is a top-notch scientist. He stated:

# Int'l Conf on Diagnosis and Treatment of Radioactive Poisoning
## Vienna 15-18 Oct 62

Source: US national; physicist on staff of US institution of higher learning.

The most interesting aspect of meeting was conduct and contributions of Prof Yu I ?oskal'ev of USSK Acad Sci. His subject was listed as "Uptake and Retention of Plutonium in Man"; no abstract was presented. When Prof ?oskal'ev spoke, however, he changed the title to "Problems of Kinetics of Uptake and Retention of Radioisotopes." During his presentation, it was suggested that the retention of multiple doses of Sr90 in the rat could not be predicted on the basis of single injection studies. After continual questioning via translation service (he apparently spoke no English), we concluded he meant by this that the rat is a continually changing animal. In any event, his paper presented nothing new and could be described as being rather elementary.

In contrast, Prof ?oskal'ev's questions throughout the four day meeting covered a wide range of topics, and left one with the impression that he was a competent individual. In response to questions, however, his answers were far from satisfactory. He have no specific answers to questions regarding Soviet experience with radioisotopes in man.

Was supposedly imprisoned during the war because of his German descent or for black market dealings. Became a party member in 1951. Had connections in the Biophysical Inst., Moscow during the first half of '52. Upon his return, he inferred that the inst. was doing intensive work on the hematological effects on dogs of radiation exposure. The ins. was also working on radiation effects on the nervous sys. of dogs, similar to the conditioned reflex experiments of Pavlov. He also stated that the inst. was doing parallel work to “Jungul” on increasing the excretion of incretagogic hormone. He also indicated results were achieved. He was married to Vera Nikolayevna Streltsova. Age 35, Medium height, Dark blond.
