While a large number of documents are available which mention King, the majority are dated after his death and in some way are related to world reaction to his assassination which was on 4 April 1968, prior to the implementation of the MCHAOS program, 4 July 1968.

# MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

## Para C:
I cannot match the documents with the list you provided.  
Please arrange the articles chronologically and number them lightly in pencil to correspond with numbers in a memo (see attached Memo from the DDA, 26 March 76, para 5). It would be useful if you would use that format for all your memos, as the way you have done it is very hard to follow without making errors. Also clipped documents have parts cut off of them or are almost unreadable. Can you provide better copies?

## Para D:
1. First document is a report whose number should be left in. PIs provide another resanitized copy.
2. Please delete dissemination controls in your sanitizations; otherwise we just have to do them over. Also classification was left on one document. See [illegible: appears to be approximately 4 words].
3. Please provide sanitized 1st page of EX-895, 7 Mar X 68.
4. Please delete cite numbers from incoming cables.

Many thanks.

# MEMORANDUM FOR: The Record
## FROM: M. D. Stevens
### SUBJECT: 
**KING, Coretta Scott**  
**#514 487**  
**AKA: Mrs. Martin Luther KING**  
**nee: Coretta SCOTT**

1. Subject, without question, is the Coretta SCOTT referred to in an FBI report on Wilfreda ABELL, #535 109, dated 10/29/54, which indicates that on 7 September 1951 ABELL, the subject of a "Security Matter-C" type investigation, communicated with C. SCOTT, Route 1, Box 158, Heiberger, Alabama, which address was identified as the residence of Coretta SCOTT. According to the postmaster at Heiberger, (in 1954?), Coretta SCOTT was then attending the New England Conservatory of Music. (See attachment A) Mrs. Coretta Scott KING is said to have attended this Conservatory and while there to have met her future husband.

2. Wilfreda ABELL, who was a clerk in the UN Secretariat from 1947 until 6/30/52 when her employment was terminated for security reasons, was said in the New York Times on 2 January 1953 to be one of 25 former employees of the UN ousted as one believed to be a communist or under communist discipline. While employed in the UN, ABELL was reportedly active on behalf of the Pro-Communist group of the UN Staff Committee and was friendly with, and actively participated in giving a party in October 1951 to honor four persons who had been dismissed by the UN for security reasons. {e.g. Jeanne PICOU, identified as a member of the French Communist Party; Mary Jane KENNEY, a CP member active in the Communist Party underground during the late 30's-early 40's; Benedict Solomon ALPER, also reported to be a CP member; and Raja HROWANI, who was reportedly a Communist Party member and had received training in the Soviet Union. The individual said to be responsible for ABELL's employment in the UN, and to have been her supervisor there at one time, was Adam TARN, a Polish citizen said to be a Communist Party member. According to the FBI report on ABELL, she registered with the American Labor Party when voting in 1949 and 1952; subscribed to the National Guardian; and attended a W.E.B. DuBois testimonial dinner in February 1951, to which she took Ealen KAGAN as her guest.

## 3. 

ABELL and Helen KAGAN, who also was terminated at the UN Secretariat for security reasons, were reported in October 1952 to frequently return to the UN premises where they were said to often be seen in its corridors conversing with certain Russians and alleged Communists. According to a confidential FBI informant, ABELL in March 1952 made a check payable to KAGAN in the amount of $150, and KAGAN had made checks payable to ABELL on a number of occasions.

Helen KAGAN is Helen KAGAN-POZNER, AKA: Elena Aleksandrovna Wilga, etc., [#3] 186, who is suspected of having long engaged in Soviet intelligence activities. Her brother, Vladimir A. POZNER, is an identified KGB officer and her cousin, Vladimir Wolf POZNER, is a known member of the French Communist Party and is suspected of involvement in Soviet intelligence. Her long-time consort, Peter WILGA, a leading figure in the CPUSA, was also suspected of Soviet intelligence connections. Helen KAGAN-POZNER WILGA is of continuing interest to the FBI and to SRS.

## 4.

At a Senate Internal Security Subcommittee hearing in New York City in late 1952, Alfreda ABELL refused direct questions of self-incrimination to say whether she was then or ever had been a communist, whether she tried to organize UN workers, or whether since leaving the UN in the Summer of 1952 she had revisited UN headquarters in the role of a communist organizer. The FBI continued to have an interest in ABELL until at least December 1961, the date of an FBI report in her file.

## 5.

The postmaster at Heilberger, Alabama in advising regarding Coretta SCOTT, as stated above, commented that she had in the past sung on the same program with Paul ROBESON at ROBESON's personal invitation. (Louis BUDENZ has stated that prior to his, [BUDENZ], defection from the Communist Party in 1945, he knew Paul ROBESON as a secret member of the Communist Party.)

M. Felton  

1-2 - I don't think we should agree. Reference to King is incidental; all other names would have to be removed.

**MEMORANDUM FOR:** Office of General Counsel  
**ATTENTION:** C/FOIA/PA  
**SUBJECT:** Request For Opinion--FOIA (b)(6) & Privacy Act  
**REFERENCE:** FOIA Request 76-382, copy attached  

1. Mr. Weisberg has requested under the FOIA information on:  
   a. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  
   b. Earl Ray  
   c. Other individuals involved with the assassination of Dr. King.  

2. To ensure consistency in making determinations for release under both the FOIA exemptions (b)(6) and the Privacy Act, of requests such as Mr. Weisberg's, would you please state the current legal criteria to apply to these type cases. Specifically, it would be helpful to the DDO to have a clearly enunciated legal opinion regarding what, if any, privacy rights the family of a deceased individual might have vis-a-vis the deceased individual. Further, what, if any, privacy rights does a convicted felon have.  

3. We are aware that each case must be judged on its own facts. Hence, we would be grateful for your opinion regarding the criteria to apply to Mr. Weisberg's request. However, a general rule applicable to the type of request also would be very useful, would expedite the processing of such requests, and would apply some consistency in the decision-making process.

# SECRET

## SUBJECT: Investigation of Death of Martin Luther King, Junior

1. Your Bureau representative in Mexico City provided our representative with composite photographs of the suspected killer of Martin Luther King, Jr., and asked for a check against visitors to the Soviet and Cuban Embassies in Mexico City during the recent months.

2. Checks for persons appearing to resemble the composite photographs were negative at both Embassies. On 30 January 1968, an unidentified white male visited the Soviet Embassy but the description did not fit either the composite photograph or the description provided by your Bureau representative. However, our representative passed copies of the photographs to your Bureau representative with the notation that he did not appear to be identical with the Bureau suspect. Our representative further stipulated that any use of the photographs in an investigation should not reveal that the photographs were made in Mexico or by this Office.

To: SAC, Washington Field  
From: Director, FBI  
**MURKIN**  

On 4-28-68, a representative of CIA advised the Bureau that a German doctor, Klaus Steer, German Director, Scientific Department, Africa, E. Merck Aktiengesellschaft, Karmstadt, Germany, had advised the American Embassy, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, that he believed he had seen an individual whom he thought to be Eric Starvo Galt at the Bristol Hotel, Lagos Nigeria, on the afternoon of 4-23-68. The individual was identified as Joe Musgagque, who is reportedly an employee of the Wilder Oil Company (address unknown).

Washington Field, check passport records for any identifying data concerning Musgagque; and also attempt to determine through the Department of State any information concerning the Wilder Oil Company, which reportedly is operating in Nigeria. If no information available in State Department records regarding the Wilder Oil Company, determine whether State Department can obtain this information from the Nigerian Embassy.

## Memorandum

**To:** Mr. W. C. Sullivan  
**Date:** 4/28/68  
**From:** J. A. Sizoo  
**T:** Murkin

Norman Pulin, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), advised this date that a German doctor, Klaus Steer, German Director, Scientific Department, Africa, E. Merck Aktiengesellschaft, Karnstadt, Germany, had advised the American Embassy, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, that he believed he had seen an individual whom he thought to be Eric Starvo Galt at the Bristol Hotel, Lagos, Nigeria, on the afternoon of 4/23/68. Because he thought the individual looked like Galt he made an effort to get some information concerning him. He found he was registered at the hotel as Joe Musgaque, Room 403, receipt number D52138. The doctor did not know if Musgaque had registered at the hotel as an American. In conversation with Musgaque the doctor learned that Musgaque was employed by the Wilder Oil Company (address unknown) and was en route to Warri Oil Field, Nigeria.

Bufiles contain no references to Joe Musgaque or the Wilder Oil Company.

Mr. Pulin, CIA, was advised that Bufiles contain no references to Joe Musgaque or Wilder Oil Company.

Wolman has Passport Number J085474, issued 1/29/68, and his permanent residence is shown as 30 Larrys Lane, Pleasantville, New York. The other individual is identified as Douglas Harry Hulbard, Passport Number 330926. Hulbard is described as a former soldier who has returned to Panama to be married. CIA did not have any further descriptive data regarding Hulbard.

These two individuals were traveling in a Chevrolet, License Number 23GH19, Motor Number 13 387 13 13711. The vehicle and license plates could not be further described by CIA. According to CIA, Wolman's passport indicates he had entered and departed El Salvador and Honduras on 4/17/68; Nicaragua on 4/18/68.

Mr. Mapother advised he has no indication why the Costa Rican authorities have requested the detention of the above-described individuals. Further, he does not know of any factual connection of these individuals with the King case. He said CIA sources were trying to develop this matter further. He also advised that CIA would send the FBI a written communication concerning this matter on 4/23/68.

At 9:10 pm 4/22/68, Norman Poulin, CIA, orally advised that a check had been made with the Costa Rican authorities and determined that Costa Rica has no information regarding the above-mentioned individuals; that Costa Rica did not request Panamanian authorities to hold these individuals, that they have to request from any American authorities to detain them; and that they have…

## Memorandum

**TO:** Mr. D. J. Brennan, Jr.  
**DATE:** April 17, 1968  

**FROM:** S. J. Papich  

**SUBJECT:** MURKIN  

Richard Ober, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), furnished the following to the Liaison Agent on April 17, 1968:

A CIA source, characterized as being very reliable, advised that on or about April 15, 1968, an individual identifying himself as Gerald Lee Richards, a U.S. seaman, called at the Tokyo, Japan, office of the National Maritime Union and asked to be signed on a ship as soon as possible. (It should be noted that reference is being made to the office of the U.S. National Maritime Union.) He was asked to furnish his local address in Tokyo, and he refused to do so. He became very agitated and then left. So far he has not returned to the aforementioned office. CIA's source stated that Richards answers the general description of the suspect in the instant case, as reported in newspapers. 

Richards volunteered information indicating that he applied for seaman's papers in San Pedro, California, on June 16, 1964, and that he registered as a member of the National Maritime Union in San Pedro on February 21, 1968. He has Social Security number 562-46-5078 and U.S. Coast Guard identifying document Z2711-782. He was born April 8, 1937, in Missouri (town not given). CIA's source described him as 5'10", 155 pounds; brown hair, receding hairline on both sides; a scar, not prominent, about two and one half inches long across the center of his forehead. His most outstanding characteristic was his grin, described as "disconcerting and resembling a grimace."

Ober advised that this same information has been given to our Legat, Tokyo. CIA is checking through available sources in Tokyo to establish the whereabouts of Richards. If this lead washes out, CIA would like to be advised.

**ACTION:** The above information is being directed to the attention of the Civil Rights Section of the General Investigative Division.

This is the case involving the murder of Martin Luther King, Jr., 4/4/68.

One of the most promising leads developed so far is the laundry tags appearing on a T-shirt and a pair of shorts apparently abandoned by the subject with the rifle that is believed to be the murder weapon. It has been determined that these laundry marks were made by a Thermo Seal marking machine manufactured by the Textile Marking Machine Company, Syracuse, New York. The manufacturer of this machine has advised that the laundry marks in question are unusual in that they consist of five characters whereas the usual code contains six characters.

These markings are also unusual because the first two characters are in smaller type while the remaining three characters are in larger type. The normal arrangement is for the first three characters to be in smaller type and for the following characters to be in larger type. The Textile Marking Machine Company has stated only a limited number of machines have been manufactured which print laundry marks in this manner. Investigation is proceeding on an expedited basis to locate these machines for the purpose of identifying the laundry marks.

Richard Helms, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, has furnished the Central Intelligence Agency file on Robert E. Kramer, M.D., Berkeley, California, whom Helms considers suspect because of his resemblance to an artist's conception of the subject and because of the Central Intelligence Agency's experience with Kramer. The Central Intelligence Agency file states Kramer has a long arrest record and contains a Berkeley Police Department photograph, dated 1/27/66, number 22805.

# Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach
## RE: MURKIN

He has been a chronic letter writer to the Central Intelligence Agency criticizing them and the Government. By letter of 12/29/67 Kraemer requested the Central Intelligence Agency to pay him $100,000 monthly for six months for a paper on geopolitical economy he had previously submitted. He concluded his letter with the statement, "In the event that you fail to acknowledge my request, I can accept no responsibility for any future efforts necessary to gain the combined ends of ideal government and financial recompense."

The only record of Kramer found in Bureau files is a memorandum from the Central Intelligence Agency, 1/18/68, advising us of his letters to the Central Intelligence Agency. No record can be located in the Identification Division but Kramer's fingerprints are being obtained from the Berkeley police.

A. C. Hayden, Intra-Division Information Unit of the Department, advised on the evening of 4/8/68 that Beatrice Rosenberg, a secretary in the Attorney General's office, had received a telephone call from a man identifying himself as Frederick Dunstan who said he resided at Route 350, Whitefield, North Carolina. Dunstan said he was calling the Attorney General to report that a white man was in his house, was drunk, had a gun and said he had killed Martin Luther King, Jr.

There is no Whitefield, North Carolina. There is a Whiteville, North Carolina. Investigation by the Charlotte Division has failed to locate a Route 350, Box 350, or Highway 350 in the Whiteville area and no record of a Frederick Dunstan has been located. No record of Dunstan could be found in Bureau files.

A pair of duckbill pliers was found among the personal effects believed to have been abandoned by the subject. These pliers bear a trademark of the Rampage Hardware Company, Los Angeles. Employees at the hardware company believe this is one of twelve pliers purchased in October, 1966. Employees have no recollection of the sale of these pliers but an exhaustive search is being made of charge sale records.

It is noted that the rifle believed to be the murder weapon was purchased in Birmingham, Alabama, 3/30/68. Binoculars found with the rifle were purchased in Memphis, 4/4/68. A latent fingerprint found on the rifle is identical with a latent fingerprint found on the binoculars. This presents a strong probability that these fingerprints are those of the subject.

## RE: MURKIN

Other major avenues of investigation include checking out white Mustang automobiles, since one was seen leaving at a high rate of speed after the shot was fired; efforts to trace a bedspread or blanket found with the gun, and the immediate processing of all suspects as soon as they are developed.

### ACTION:
1. Attached is a memorandum for the White House, the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General and the Civil Rights Division.
2. Investigation is continuing on an all-out basis.

## Memorandum

**TO:** Mr. Rosen  
**FROM:** C. L. McGowan  
**DATE:** April 10, 1968  
**SUBJECT:** MURKIN  

This is the matter involving the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King.

Liaison advised of the receipt of information from Richard Helms, Director of CIA, that one Robert Kramer was a possible suspect. According to information furnished by Howard Osborn, Director of Security of CIA, Kramer, who is a doctor, has been a source of trouble to CIA for some time. Only recently Mr. Helms received a very cryptic telegram from Kramer. In reviewing Kramer’s file, they noted a photograph which bears a very strong resemblance to recent pictures of artist drawings of the killer which have appeared in local papers. The likeness was so striking that Mr. Helms thought it should be brought to the attention of the FBI immediately.

> **ACTION:**  
> Senior Resident Agent Jesse Hall, Alexandria, Virginia, was telephonically contacted and instructed to obtain full details from the files of CIA Headquarters at Langley, Virginia, together with all background information on Kramer, as well as a photograph, so that this matter could be thoroughly checked out.

# SUBJECT: STAAR, Richard Felix
- aka: GWIADZOWSKI, Richard Felix
- DPOB: 10 January 1923, Warsaw, Poland

Subject of FBI investigations in 1954 (Voice of America) and 1956 (USIA) - Bureau File 123-15026.

Of possible interest is similarity between his name and that of "Eric Starvo GALT." In that, Richard STAAR is similar. GWIADZDA is "star" in Polish. Among STAAR's references on a 1949 PHS is Professor Stanley AULT, Purdue University, Lafayette, Indiana.

From 1959 to 1962 (latest information available) STAAR was a Professor of Political Science at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia. His local residence addresses during that period are shown as 303 Vickers Drive, N.E., Atlanta, 7, and 879 Clifton Rd., N.E., Atlanta, Georgia.

**Central Intelligence Agency**  
**Washington, D.C.**

**Rt. 12, Frederick, Md. 21701**  
**7/21/77**

Dear Mr. Wilson,

The news account of your coming release of an additional 4,000 pages on what might be called mind-bending reminds me that my requests seem to [??] cover this and that you have not notified me of this release. I do want these. If you interpret my prior requests as not covering this, then consider this a new request. My recollection is that my initial requests cover anything and everything directly or indirectly related to this subject. That you have interpreted my requests as I have is evidence from prior correspondence notifying me of releases.

> Under the Act there is authority for the remission of all costs and fees. I believe I meet the requirements for this remission and I make the request formally. My work is restricted exclusively to what is now regarded as important historical cases. In one on which I have paid the CIA large sums without compliance, the King assassination, the previous Attorney General so held, formally, confirmed by a federal judge. I have already arranged to give all my records, not just these; to a university system. I believe at an earlier date I reserved the right to recover these fees. I have delivered a formal appeal pending a determination of a judge that there be a ruling by the Department of Justice with regard to me and on this. The Department provided a bargain-basement response, a 60% remission that I have appealed and will if necessary litigate. I hope the CIA will act favorably on this.

It has been a very long time since I have heard from you about a multitude of requests all long overdue by your own backlog claims. One of those is on the King assassination. In that you recall, you estimated a $1,000 fee and asked for a $500 deposit. What you have sent is ludicrous. In the long time in which I have heard and received nothing further, I think you have in effect misused the request after charging fees so this is also an appeal on the King/Ray records.

I am asking again when I may expect to hear from you on all the other requests, including my PA request for the records on me. The appeal is several years old now. My recollection is that your last reference to this stated the processing of the appeal had not been completed. I have rights under the Act to non copies. I want to exercise those rights. This is impossible without obtaining all copies first. As I have told you repeatedly I would prefer not to have to litigate this. What I am thus really asking you is does the CIA want me to suit it on a request that goes back to 1971 and on which it is not in compliance? Not even processed the appeal? 

Among the factors making it difficult to keep track of these non-compliances is your failure to respond as well as to comply. I believe I have asked this before. If I have then what follows is an appeal from a refusal, if I have not it is a new request. I would like all records relating to my requests and appeals, including their sequential relationships to other requests, under both Acts and particularly as this relates to compliance with prior requests.

**Sincerely,**  
**Harold Weisberg**

Dear Mr. Wilson:

On behalf of Mr. Harold Weisberg of Frederick, Maryland, I request access to the following:

1. All records pertaining to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
2. All records pertaining to the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
3. All records pertaining to James Earl Ray, under whatever name or alias.
4. All records on any alleged or [suspected] accomplice or associate in the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
5. All collections of published materials on the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
6. All analyses, commentaries, reports, or investigations on or in any way pertaining to any published materials on the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. or the authors of said materials.

Sincerely yours,

21 JUN 1976

James H. Lesar, Esquire  
1231 Fourth Street, S.W.  
Washington, D.C. 20024  

Dear Mr. Lesar:

This acknowledges receipt of your letter of 11 June 1976 on behalf of Mr. Harold Weisberg requesting, under provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, access to any CIA records dealing with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and/or James Earl Ray and any of his alleged or suspected accomplices in Dr. King's assassination.

I shall arrange for a search of CIA files and shall be in further communication with you once the search has been completed and any records found reviewed for releasability under the Act.

As you may know, the heavy volume of Freedom of Information requests received by the Agency has resulted in processing backlogs. If we do not respond within the 10 working days stipulated by the Act, it is your right to construe this as a denial, subject to appeal to the CIA Information Review Committee. It would seem more reasonable, however, for us to continue processing your request and to respond as soon as feasible. Any denials of records could be appealed at that time. Unless we hear from you otherwise, we will assume that this is agreeable to you and proceed on this basis.

For your information, I am enclosing a copy of our fee schedule. If the charges seem likely to be considerable, I shall provide you with an estimate and perhaps require a partial payment in advance of processing.

Sincerely,  
/s/GFW

Dear Mr. Lesar:  

You will recall that our letter of 21 June 1976 acknowledged receipt of your letter on behalf of Mr. Harold Weisberg requesting, under provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, access to any CIA records dealing with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and to those dealing with James Earl Ray and any of his alleged or suspected accomplices in Dr. King’s assassination.

We find that we are unable to respond to your request as it now stands due to legal and regulatory restrictions on the release of personal information from official records. In that light, please be advised that we can proceed no further with your request unless and until we are in receipt of notarized statements of release from Mrs. Coretta King and James Earl Ray, respectively. Those statements should be quite specific as to what areas of personal information are and are not authorized for release by this Agency to you and your client. If all information in our records is releasable, that should be so stated; if only such information as relates to specific incidents or to specific periods of time is releasable, those caveats should be clearly stated.

Finally, we must ask that you provide a statement of willingness to pay search and duplication fees as required by this request and in line with the fee schedule enclosed. It has been estimated that such charges could approach $190. Along with the notarized statements above, and the statement of willingness to pay all search and copying charges (or those up to an established limit), we would require a down payment of half the anticipated charges. Payment should be made to this office in the form of a check or money order payable to Treasurer of the United States.

Sincerely,

Gene F. Wilson  
Information and Privacy Coordinator  

Enclosure

## ATTORNEY AT LAW
1231 FOURTH STREET, S.W.  
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024  
TELEPHONE (202) 484-6023  

December 3, 1976

Mr. Gene F. Wilson  
Information and Privacy Coordinator  
Central Intelligence Agency  
Washington, D.C. 20505  

Dear Mr. Wilson:

In response to your letter of November 30, 1976, Mr. Harold Weisberg has authorized me to state his willingness to pay search and copying charges up to the amount of $1,000 if such charges are required by his Freedom of Information Act request for records pertaining to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and his assassination. Because you require a down payment of half the anticipated charges, I enclose a check for $500.00.

This payment of $500.00 and any subsequent payments made in connection with this request are tendered with the express understanding that Mr. Weisberg does not waive his right to recover them.

C.I.A. regulations provide:

> Records shall be furnished without charge or at a reduced rate whenever the Coordinator determines that waiver or reduction of the charge is in the public interest because furnishing the information can be considered as primarily benefiting the general public. The Coordinator also may waive or reduce the charge whenever he determines that the interest of the government would be served there by. 32 C.F.R. §1900.25(a).

In accordance with this regulation, I call upon you to determine that it is in the public and governmental interest to waive search and copying charges incurred in connection with Mr. Weisberg's request. Enclosed herein is a copy of a letter to Deputy Attorney General Harold R. Tyler, Jr. which makes a similar request of the Department of Justice. The reasons expressed in that letter for granting a waiver are incorporated in my request that you grant a waiver.

Should you require it, I will provide you with affidavits by myself, Mr. Weisberg, and others in support of this request for a waiver of the search and copying charges for these records. If you do wish supporting affidavits, I would appreciate it if you would...
```

[Page 2]

inform me of this as soon as possible. I would also request  
that you indicate what standards, if any, you have established  
for determining whether or not a request for waiver should be  
granted.

You state that you can proceed no further with Mr. Weisberg's  
request "unless and until we are in receipt of notarized state-  
ments of release from Mrs. Coretta King and James Earl Ray,  
respectively." Because Mr. Weisberg's request undoubtedly com-  
prises records which do not involve any proper claim of privacy;  
this cannot be true. I do enclose, however, a copy of a notarized  
waiver by James Earl Ray. I will immediately contact Mrs. King  
about a waiver by her. In the meantime, I request that you proceed  
to make available those records responsive to Mr. Weisberg's re-  
quest which do not involve any proper claim of invasion of privacy.

Sincerely yours,

James H. Lesar

OSI CONTENT: THE CHARLES PARKER mentioned above is believed to be this same individual as CHARLES MEDICO PARKER. He registered a dedication in the U.S. Navy Reserves because of his association with Communist ideology, BOOTH's continued affiliation with PARKER certainly places both individuals in a category which is least highly questionable.

L. Further inquiry concerning ESTHER E. EICHELZKY forced the recently divorced VADIM PAYOV and reportedly returned to the Komsomol area.

OSI CONTENT: Likison has been affected with another government agency in this liaison, in an effort to determine the present whereabouts of SUBJECT.

5. The Alaskan Labor Defender, a monthly news publication, had recently appeared in the Fairbanks area with its first publication dated July 1955. Previous editions of this newspaper appeared in the area as early as 1953, but it has since discontinued further publication of critical socio-economic topics. The Alaskan Labor Defender covered articles contained from its INITIAL publication, one of which quoted a speech given by F. O. D. DJOTAS. One article quoted a speech made at a rally held at Carnegies Hall in New York on 29 February 1956 which relates to advisedly. In referring to the hangovers' Ables bus protocol, “decided by clear thinking, they (the leaders) have discovered that the real problem was at bottom an economic policy." 

> "It is likely they have discovered Karl Marx." (In referring to EARL MARX, they were probably referring to KARL MARX, co-author of the Communist Manifesto.)

Quoted below are portions of another article under the caption "It's like to think" written by ERNEST GRIFFIN, Independent Candidate from Fairbanks, Alaska, for the House of Representatives:

* * * "Today there seems to be little or no attention paid to the examples set by the founders of this new nation, the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, or the Negro people's claim as citizens of the United States." * * * (In reference to the Constitution of the United States) * * * "Although this Constitution ranks above every other written Constitution for excellence of its coats, its simplicity, the precision of its language, and its judicious nature of definiteness in principle, it has become a neglected Constitution." * * *

> "But we can be destroyed unless we lose faith and reveal itself. I have been told by a [mad man?], it is most regrettable to the teacher and supporters of the White Citizens Council."
>
> "The Negro people of the South have been suffering this, amid excuses and accepting conditions that exist in the South. They have braved in Alabama, and have turned around to bolster those in opportunity by having courage enough to challenge the Jim Crow laws."

Quoted below is a portion of an editorial under this caption: *The Largest Picket Line in the World* who is appearing in the May 1956 publication of the Alaskan Labor Defender.

1. Every union local, every worker in office, factory or workshop, must make their personal obligation to take action now! This is no time for passing the buck! This is the time to collect, and send it to the Montgomery Improvement Association, c/o of the Rev. M. L. King, Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, Montgomery, Alabama!

> The above editorial is authored by [Harold Bobbs?], president of candidates of the Socialist Workers Party, and refers to the $50,000 being raised in Montgomery, Alabama, and what it means in a struggle against Jim Crow.

"It is actually the greatest danger under that. The prescriptive, violent terror, and hatred in the South is being perpetuated against any white workers who dare to solidarity with Negroes. The murderous white Citizens Council are not only rabidly Jim Crow but Anti-Semitic and Anti-labor. Their aim is to preserve the system of color segregation and discrimination on this foundation, up which rests the open group structure of the 'Right to Work' South."

Also appearing in this issue is an article relating that the Catholic Worker has protested the padlocking of the Daily Worker as a violation of the freedom of the press.

In articles appearing under the caption: *Auto Workers Take Home Pay*, the headline reflects the "demand for a 30-hour week at $10 hours pay" by the UAW, Ford Local 600, and the AFL-CIO. Another article under the caption: *Employment Falling Off; Productivity is Increasing* quotes JOHN CLARK, president of the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, stating that this union "licenses to do something about declining employment in the retail industry." Also set forth in this issue of the Alaskan Labor Defender is the *Platform of: DOUGLAS W. HAMILTON, Independent Candidate for the Senate; CHARLES GRIFFITH; HENRY POLLARD, and MILO MAPEK, Independent Candidates for the House of Representatives. Two of the issues listed on the "platforms" are "stop the government's thought-control with which is pushing America."

**SUBJECT:** Excerpts from Monthly Counterintelligence Report,  
**SOURCE:** DRI GSI, AIC  
**DATE OF INFORMATION:** 1 - 30 April 1956  
**DATE OF REPORT:** 14 May 1956  

Excerpts of interest taken from the GSI Monthly Counterintelligence Report are as follows:

## REPORT:

1. An aircraft passenger list from the Seattle Daily Times revealed  
   that ARTHUR arrived in that city from Seattle, Washington on 5 March 1956.  
   A later 148 list has been reported for Anchorage on 9 March 1956. A labor  
   memo revealed that again AMR ARRIVED in Anchorage on 2 March 1956. This  
   information was filed in 1951, claimed to be part of the Italian branch of the Communist Party from 1945 to 1950.

2. Another passenger list from the Seattle Bureau revealed a similar  
   situation involving James for Anchorage on 9 March 1956. Research  
   conducted indicated that he began his journey on 1 March 1956. The  
   Federal Inquiry by this office has disclosed issue R. 82809 related to  
   the former visa. James was released on 14 April 1956 and requested a  
   self-managed contractor on the Anchorage trip.

3. HENRY RADE was recently reported as staying for Anchorage View,  
   East County, in the latter's dispatch dated 19 May.  
   General news is pending confirmation, as an indication of further clarity in  
   his recently reported the following situation related with  
   an highly controversial license through Marshall associations.  
   Once in San Diego, Manuel Rade was reported as the General Valley Reserve Association, and the discussion proved to be cautious in the latest news; also, a local landscape proposal was included where a fund raising activity was noted this weekend.

OSI COMMENT: The CHARLES PARKER mentioned above is believed to be the same individual as CHARLES LINCOLN PARKER, who resigned a commission in the U.S. Naval Reserve because of admitted pro-Russian sympathies. BOXTO: continual agitation, past association with Communists, and apparent association with PARKER, certainly places both individuals in a category which is, at least, highly questionable.

l. Further inquiry concerning ESTHER M. ERICHSEN revealed she recently divorced WILFORD PAYOV and reportedly returned to the Homer, Alaska area.

OSI COMMENT: Lainson has been affected with another government agency in the Mincholt area in an effort to determine the present whereabouts of SUBJECT.

5. The Alaska Labor Defender, a monthly new publication, has recently resumed in the Fairbanks area with its first publication dated May 1956. Previous editions of this newspaper appeared in the Subarctic area in early 1955, but were discontinued after publication of two editions due to the refusal of a local printing firm to print subversive material. Among editorials appearing in the Alaska Labor Defender are several articles condensed from the "WILLIST," a publication of the Socialist Workers Party, which is cited by the U.S. Attorney General as subversive. One article quoted a speech made by L. D. BOIS at a rally held at Carlisle Hall in New York on 29 March 1956 which relates, in referring to the Montgomery, Alabama protest, "led by clear thinking, they (the Negroes) have discovered that the race problem was at bottom a economic problem."

- (In referring to Karl Marx, they were probably referring to KARL MARX, co-author of the Communist Manifesto)

> Quoted below are portions of another article under the caption "It's time to think" written by ERNEST GRIFFIN, Independent Candidate from Fairbanks, Alaska, for the House of Representatives:

* * * Today there seems to be little or no attention paid to the examples, by the founders of this new nation, the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, or the Negro people as citizens of these United States. * * * (In reference to the Constitution of the United States) * * * "Although this Constitution ranks above every other written Constitution for excellence of its scheme, its intelligibility, the precision of its language, and its judicious mixture of definiteness in principle, it has become a neglected Constitution." * * *

* * * "But we can be destroyed when we lose faith or hope and when life itself seems like a story told by a dead man, as it must seem to the members and supporters of the White Citizens Council...*

The Negro people of the South have been suffering time, making excuses and accepting conditions that exist in the South. Until a few brave men in Alabama turned what seemed to be a tragedy into an opportunity by having courage enough to challenge the Jim Crow laws.* * *

Quoted below is a portion of an editorial under the caption *The Longest Picket Line in the World*, also appearing in the May 1956 publication of the Alaskan Labor Defender:

* * * "Every union local, every worker in office, factory or workshop, must make it a personal obligation to take action now! This is no time for passing the buck! This is the time to collect it and send it to the Montgomery Improvement Association, care of the Rev. M. L. King, Dexter Ave. Baptist Church, Montgomery, Alabama."*

The above statement was issued by Harold Dobb, presidential candidate of the Socialist Workers Party, and refers to the 50,000 Negroes in Montgomery, Alabama who are in a struggle against Jim Crow.

* * * "Actually this struggle goes deeper and wider than that. The present wave of race terror and hatred in the South is being fanned by the White Citizens Council. What is not generally known is that this terror is directed against any white workers who dare to solidarity with Negroes. The murderous White Citizens Council are not only rabidly Jim Crow but Anti-Semitic and Anti-Labor. Their aim is to perpetuate the system of color segregation and discrimination as the foundation upon which rests the open shop structure of the 'Right to Work' laws." * * *

Also appearing in this issue is an article relating that the Catholic Worker has protested the peddling of the Daily Worker as a violation of the freedom of the press.

An article appearing under the caption *Auto Workers Talk Home Pay Decibels* reflects the "demands for a 30 hour week at $10 hour pay" by the UAW, Ford local 600, and the AFL-CIO. Another article under the caption "Employment Falling Off; Productivity is Increasing," quotes John Clark, president of the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, as stating that his union "intends to do something" about declining employment in the metal industry. Also in this issue of the Alaskan Labor Defender is the "Platform" of Donald W. Beilin, Independent Candidate for the Senate, Ernest Griffith, Mike Doolittle, and Tito Napolitano, Independent Candidates for the House of Representatives. Two of the issues listed on the "platform" are "Stop the government's thought-control witch hunt which is pushing America."

# Assassination Tapes

The rulers of the state are the only ones who should have the privilege of lying, either at home or abroad; they may be allowed to lie for the good of the state.  
—Plato: The Republic, Book Three

It's a little frightening. The machine can listen to what you're saying and tell, with a high degree of reliability, whether or not you are lying. It's called the Psychological Stress Evaluator, and it is, in effect, a lie detector. Unlike the polygraph, it needs no physical connection to the subject; therefore it can be used without his knowledge. It works from recordings of his voice, so anything on tape, sound track or phonograph record is fair game for the machine. It is the first lie detector that can be used on a dead man.

> Early this year, one of these instruments came into my hands. I resolved to use it to probe one of the darkest mysteries of recent history, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. I set about collecting every recording I could lay my hands on of anyone who had any direct knowledge of the affair. Soon I had compiled the tape-recorded testimony of twenty-two persons—eyewitnesses, Dallas policemen, the pathologist who conducted the autopsy, members and staff of the Warren Commission, Jim Garrison, Clay Shaw, and even Earl Warren.

I ran the tapes through the PSE systematically, taking each controversial point in turn. Did the rifle which belonged to Lee Harvey Oswald kill President Kennedy? Was Oswald the only person involved? What of those mysterious autopsy photos—what did the Warren Commission never saw—do they support the Commission’s lone-gunman, single-bullet theory? And what about the Warren Commission itself? Did its members conspire to cover up the truth?

Slowly a picture emerged. It is blurred, and it is not the picture I expected. Not all the details are there, but I guarantee this: you may believe the lone-gunman theory of the Warren Report, or you may believe the government-conspiracy theory of Mark Lane, Jim Garrison and others, but either way you are wrong.

The PSE is not a crystal ball. It was invented as an interrogation aid, a function it performs well. To my knowledge, this was the first instance of its use as a tool for historical research. To understand what I did with the PSE, one should know something about the device itself.

I first heard of the Psychological Stress Evaluator last year, when I met two of its inventors, Allan D. Bell, Jr., and Charles R. McQuiston. Bell and McQuiston, both former influential colonels, retired from Army Intelligence several years ago to form a company called Detector Counterintelligence and Security, Inc. It was a logical second career for the two men. Both are experts in the technology of espionage. Either one could pick the lock on your front door in less time than it takes you to find your key. Colonel Bell wears a Black Belt in karate, is an accomplished swordsman and small-arms expert, and has a dozen inventions to his credit, from anti-bugging devices to a miniaturized microcomputer. Colonel McQuiston is one of the foremost polygraph experts in the U.S., a specialist in radio and audio surveillance, and a qualified locksmith.

# Polygraphs

Standard polygraphs measure four variables: pulse, blood respiration and perspiration. Some measure additional physiological variables. The more variables measured, the more reliable the polygraph. 

And McQuilson discovered that the dynamics composing the human voice are fixed: they shift very slightly from ten to fourteen times every second. But the speaker is under stress, this frequency modulation disappears. There is a strong indication that the speaker is lying.

The PSE itself is built into an attaché case, similar to an electrocardiograph, and a number of buttons and knobs. A single cable connects the PSE to the tape recorder.

> As the tape recorder reels slowly, turn and a rumble issues from its speaker, the PSE silently dances back and forth across the moving chart paper, leaving behind a ragged trail. The recorder is stopped, and the chart is printed, and that’s it for the day.

On the afternoon of the first day, Kradz showed us how to look for the unstressed voice looks like an untrimmed hedge, with stalls of different heights sticking up down the street, and that hedge begins to look trimmed. The greater the stress, the smoother the shape. If the subject was experiencing stress, that stress would cause deception, the over-all outline of the figure tends to take on a rectangular shape, a concertina as seen by the player. Kradz showed us another slide of charts made during actual police interrogations. 

He held up the background of each case and pointed out the tell-tale signs of deception, whether they were present. 

> The more I read, the more I doubted what happened that day in Dallas

- First, I must take Deklerk's theory on the PSE.
- Second, I must review my installation of its output with his staff, in respect of accuracy. This seemed re- | so agreed. 
- The next day I learned the theory of the PSE. There is, first of all, the matter of the "outside issue." 

Most people, Kradz pointed out, have some sort of deep secret they don't want known. When faced with a polygraph examination, a person may be more concerned than he is about the actual substance of the interrogation. This can produce irrelevance in some of his answers, and mislead the examiner. Therefore it is necessary for the examiner to interview the subject before the examination, go over all of the questions he intends to ask, and assure the subject he will ask only these questions. 

> I had reason to remember this later.

The interrogation always includes the very first real interrogation tape. The examiner always asks some innocuous questions, such as, “Do you like the color blue?” in order to observe the subject’s general state of tension. And there is one “red-herring” question.

The red herring is used to identify the "guilt complex responder." Such a person shows stress when responding to any accusatory question. The examiner may ask, “Did you steal the watch?” when it is money, not a watch, that is missing on the stressed individual with the examiner, who carefully calibrates their response to the missing money.

That night the class was given tapes of real police interrogations. In most cases, Kradz was the examiner, and in every case, I knew the background and resolution of the matter. One case I was assigned concerned a young man accused of stealing money from his father’s store. Kradz asked by asking the “outside-issue” question. No, the young man replied, he was not afraid Kradz would ask him a question they hadn’t discussed. Then the following exchange took place:
- “Do you live in Howard County?”
- “Yes.”
- “Do you suspect someone of having taken the money?”
- “No.”
- “Are you wearing a white shirt?”
- “Yes.”
- “Do you know who took the money?”
- “No.”
- “Are you wearing a ring?”
- “Yes.”
- “Did you take the money?”
- “No.”

a successful criminal lawyer and  
tor of the Committee, in a modern  
building a few blocks from the White  
House. Fenstervaid is a small, dapper man  
with a thin beard. Smith is a lean, intense  
smoker. Both men appeared to be forties.

"Here we begin," I said. "I think I should  
on that I used to work for the CIA."  
I had access to certain, the theory that  
J. Edgar Hoover, it seems, assured  
there are years; no one ever saw or heard any-  
suggesting the Agency was involved in  
assassination. I never met anyone  
I thought capable of doing it. Still,  
I learned through bitter experience of  
sissue offers. Episodes of paranoia  
occurred every through life. I thought  
let's get that issue out of the way.

I and Fenstervaid exchanged  
smiles. Fenstervaid told me he did not  
necessarily believe the CIA was lying, and they certainly  
lacked a formal agency period.  
I began to outline my project  
if they had heard of the PSE. Both  
had only heard of it. I described  
I might be used as a research tool. They  
understood what I was pos-  
sibly tremendously enthusiastic. Yes,  
there were many key statements  
somewhere, they could be made,  
simple specific references for them.  
I began to be in contact when they came and  
for me.

I was waiting. I experimented with  
it. I telephoned a friend and told him  
of the device. I asked if he was willing  
by a little game to test it out, and he  
did. I picked a number between one  
and. I asked him, "Is the number one?"  
the number two?" and so on, he an-  
swered no each time. I recorded his  
answers, ran them through the PSE and  
I him back. The number he picked,  
was five.

I was dumbfounded. He had not heard  
PSE and had thought I might be on-  
some elaborate joke at his expense.  
When I called back and correctly identi-  
the number he had picked, he realized  
serious. And I was shocked.  

I learned the same game several times  
others did not always have similar  
success. With Bernard Fenstervaid, I was  
only to narrow the answer down to two  
friends, one of which turned out to be cor-  

---

**Next I played the Lomax-Liebler tape.**  
Apparently Mark Lane had been on an  
earlier Lomax program, and now Liebler  
was on to rebut him. I didn't need the PSE to  
know that Liebler was stressed. He  
seemed very agitated, and his breathing  
audibly indicated his tension. He was angry  
about the things Lane had said, the ques-  
tions Lomax was asking him, and the reac-  
tion of the studio audience. Given his highly  
emotional state, he did not seem a very  
promising subject for the PSE. Nonetheless,  
I decided to give it a try.

Charting a tape with the PSE is a long  
and tedious process, and it was impractical  
to chart the entire program: I ran some of  
Liebler's statements which were not dis-  
puted and discovered, as I had expected,  
a great deal of stress. He was pretty  
charged up.  

Most of the exchange between Liebler,  
Lomax and the audience was argumenta-  
tive and did not deal with specific factual  
points. I found two key statements by Liebler,  
though, and charted them.

The first statement, in response to a ques-  
tion by Lomax, was, "I have no doubt about  
the conclusions of the [Warren] Report."  
Plenty of stress was evident, but not much.  

The second statement related to those  
Warren Commission documents which were  
not included in the Report - they were  
looked up in the National Archives...  
Liebler asked Liebler if there was anything in  
documents which would alter his lie-  
belief opinion. Taken literally, it was a strange  
question, since Liebler had seen the docu-  
ments, and if they would alter his opinion,  
they would already have done so. Lomax  
probably meant to ask if the documents  
would conflict with the conclusions of the  
Warren Report. Whatever Liebler thought  
the question meant, he answered quickly,  
"Oh, none, none at all." The PSE showed  
some stress here than during any of  
Liebler's other statements.

It was all pretty endless and fuzzy, and  
didn't tell me much I'd already known:  
Wesley Lieber was pretty upset when he  
appeared on the Lomax program. I  
hoped that the CBS tapes would yield more  
enlightening results.

I finally received a call from CBS's  
Washington office saying the tapes had  
arrived. I broke a few traffic laws getting there to pick up the tapes and returning  
to my apartment. I had already selected the  
tapes I wanted to check from the transcript of  
the program. I turned down the first tape on  
my recorder, ran it down to the first point of  
interest, and turned on the PSE.

For the next three days and nights, I ran  
charts. When I finished, I had a splitting  
headache, my kitchen floor was ankle deep  
in chart paper, but I had a much clearer  
idea of what did and did not happen that  
day in Dallas.

Before I described my results, I feel that  
I must offer the reader a few comments and  
thoughts.

This didn't really clear things up. There were several obvious alternative explanations for Odom's stress. For example, there...

## Section 6

> **Deception is not proved only by stress, but given witness' testimony;**
> 
> to arrive at the truth.

The first person on the PSE who had direct knowledge of the assassination was Oswald's widow, Marina. Unfortunately, only one of her statements was on the CBS tapes—Oswald had been shot. The PSE said she was telling the truth.

The final had been one of the major points of controversy raised by critics of the Warren Report. The debate centered on two points: whether the Mannlicher-Carcano alleged to have belonged to Oswald was the rifle found by the Dallas police in the Texas School Book Depository, and whether that particular gun could have been the murder weapon.

### Conclusion

1. On the tapes, Darrell C. Tomlinson, an investigator, testified that he had found a live bullet on a stretch which he believed had carried Governor Connally. There was no stress in this statement. The PSE said he was telling the truth.
2. Dr. Joseph O. Nicoll, Superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Investigation for the State of Illinois, on ballistic tests on bullet fragments found in the presidential limousine, and on the intact bullet found by Tomlinson. Nicoll testified that both the intact bullet and the bullet found had been fired by the Mannlicher-Carcano. He, too, was apparently telling the truth.

> Deputy Constable Steven Weitzman of the Dallas Police claimed that he found Oswald's Mannlicher-Carcano on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. However, on the day of the assassination, he had told the press that the rifle he found was a German Mauser. The following day, he signed an affidavit to that effect. But on CBS tapes he testified that he had been mistaken about that point, that it had really...

## Introduction
The PSE confirmed that he thought he had seen a puff of smoke on the knoll, but it could not support his claim that he had heard a shot from that direction. Another witness, Charles Brehm, was quoted by Mark Lane as having said that he had seen a portion of the President's skull flying back over the left rear end of the limousine. Lane offered his evidence as a shot from the grassy knoll. On the CBS tapes, Brehm stated heatedly that he had been quoted out of context, and emphatically denied that any shots had come from the knoll. Despite his emotional state, there was almost no stress in this statement.

Officer Jacks of the Dalllas police, who was riding in the limousine of Vice President Johnson, denied that any of the shots had come from the direction of the grassy knoll. The PSE turned up a fair degree of stress.

## Witness Accounts
Three witnesses, Mrs. Caroline Walther, Arnold Rowland, and Howard Brennan, claimed to have seen gunmen in the windows of the Texas School Book Depository building. Mrs. Walther said she saw two men, one armed with a rifle, the second...

**Chief Justice Warren:**
> "We explored both theories and found no evidence that either group was involved"

With a shorter gun, Roland told the Warren Commission he had seen two men, one elderly Negro, in the window Oswald is alleged to have fired from, but on the CBS tapes he claimed he had seen an armed man at a different window. The Commission relied heavily on the testimony of Brennan, who claimed to have been in the window actually during the last shots. The PSE showed hard stress in his testimony.

The PSE confirmed...

## Autopsy Findings
The President's body was flown to Washington, D.C. There, approximately eight hours after the shooting, an autopsy was performed at Bethesda Naval Hospital. Because of the tracheostomy, the nature of the neck wound could no longer be observed and was, at first, overlooked. Later, after consulting the Bethesda doctors, the Bethesda pathologists concluded that it was an exit wound. The autopsy report stated that there were two entry wounds, one low in the rear scalp and one at the right base of the neck, and a large irregular wound in the right side of the head.

The confusion was compounded when two FBI agents present at the autopsy reported that a wound had been found in the President's back, and had no corresponding exit wound had been located. Diagrams made during the autopsy seemed to confirm this, showing the lower of the entry wounds to be below the shoulders, not at the base of the neck. What became of the bullet? The agents reported that Bethesda doctors thought the bullet had dropped from the wound when the Dallas doctors attempted external massage. But this was the shot that the Commission claimed had passed through Kennedy and struck Governor Connally.

> K-rays and color photographs of the autopsy were made. The brain was removed from the body. Brain and skin slides were prepared for microscopic examination. Remarkably, the Warren Commission relied entirely solely on the testimony of Captain James J. Humes, one of the Pathologists who conducted the autopsy.

## Conclusion
Both Dr. Perry and Captain Humes were interviewed on the CBS tapes. Perry was asked about the throat wound he saw when the President was brought to Parkland Hospital. His answer seemed unbelievable. He neither confirmed nor denied that he thought it was an entry wound, "Actually, I didn't really give it much thought," he replied. He...

# Assassination Tapes

*FROM PAGE 236*

...hard stress on the PSE. Unfortunately, he made no other definite statement on the nature of the wound. 

The interview with Captain Humes was informative. Just before the interview, Humes had re-examined the autographs and X-rays, and he disclaimed any change on the C3S tapes. "I had not been asked to precisely send the location of the wounds. How ever, I produced a sketch which he represented as the exact locations such as the interviewer asked. 

"You realize that the photographs verify that the wounds were as shown here?" 

"Sir," he replied, "No stress." 

"Is there any wound other than the base of ‘neck’ and one up in the scalp?" "No, there were not." Moderate not enough to suggest deception. 

"Is there any doubt that the wound at the back of the President’s head was an round?" "There is absolutely no doubt, against the basis of a conjecture of exile..." At this point, the stress led…

...where were the entry wounds to... 

"Posturing, one low in the right scapula and one in the base of the right." Hard stress again. 

...If he absolutely certain that what I was an entry wound was, in fact, indeed we can." Hard stress. 

Interviewer asked was one of the CBS and most outdid of the CBS. 

“I simply do not feel it believed much,” 

He was saying, but the frequency of micros tear stresses suggested that he nearly as confident of his observation as claimed to be. As Dr. Perry had said, "sometimes it's not easy to tell if I would want an exit wound." 

The interviewer asked him one good "both" question: 

"you have any different conclusion, different ideas, any different thoughts…?" 

"Seeing the photographs?" 

"You had that a number?" 

"I expected Captain Humes, ‘we think’, it up very well, and very closely, wrongly before the Warren Commission..."

Stress was hard.

Again there was the Warren Commission investigators, also spoken at tapes. He said that the case against fitted together very well, and that could find none among actual inquiries that have criticized the Commission very severely, but I have never found that they discovered any evidence of any kind that didn’t discover and use in determining the case as we did."

Hard stress once again. The word “never” was a perfectly “trimmed hedge.” 

"I have found nothing since that time," he continued, "to change my view, nor have I heard of anything that has changed the view of any member of the commission since that time." 

The stress was hard. As I had now come to expect, the word “nothing” seemed a particularly beautiful example of stress. Another word seemed to show even more stress: “member.” Could he have been thinking of someone in particular? On January 19, 1970, Senator Richard B. Russell, a member of the Warren Commission, revealed that he had never believed that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. 

I had charted the list of the assassination tapes. Of course, these few thousand feet of recording tape are only a small fraction of the relevant testimony recorded and stored away in the archives of television news departments. 

There is, for example, Lee Harvey Oswald, as he was led through the Dallas police station, denying that he had killed the President. There are statements by Marina Oswald, Jack Ruby and others. 

"I have no doubt that with these tapes, a Psychological Stress Evaluator, and time, we can very detailed about the assassination of John F. Kennedy could be reconstructed, a picture that might even reveal the identities of the assassins and their co-conspirators. I hope that sooner or later someone does this. I have gone as far as the private resources of a free-lance writer permit."

> What, given the sample of testimony I have processed with the PSE, can I say about the assassination? 
> 
> We should first examine the testimony which was found, since it is almost certain that these people were telling the truth as they saw it. This strongly suggests the following: 
> 
> 1. Oswald owned a rifle. 
> 2. A bullet fired from that rifle was found on Governor Connally’s stretcher at Parkland Hospital.
> 3. Bullet fragments alleged to have been found in the presidential limousine also came from Oswald's rifle.
> 4. At least one eyewitness believes he saw a gunman once the grassy knoll, but another is equally certain that shots came from that direction.
> 5. Oswald shot and killed Officer Tippit.
> 6. At least one member of the Warren Commission said he really believed in the validity of the Warren Report.
> 7. Jim Garrison had little or no case against Clay Shaw. 

Almost all of this tends to support, in one way or another, the Warren Report. But now...

# Document Title

*The claim that Oswald's rifle was in the Texas School Book Depository.*

The claim that bullet holes matching Oswald's rifle were found in the same place.  
The claim that one gunman was seen in the "Oswald window" of the Dallas Book Store.  
The claim that two gunmen were seen from that window.

Another claim that no shots came from Assassination, and a claim by the witness saw the gun smoke on the knoll that one heard a shot from that direction.  
A claim by a Dallas policeman that neither he nor Officer Tippitt knew Oswald.  
The claim by the pathologist—the Commission's only source of information about the autopsy—that the X-rays and autopsy photographs support the tests before the Commission.

The claim by a member of the Warren Commission that there was nothing that supported the Warren Report.  
The claim by Earl Warren that the Commission found no evidence of a conspiracy; that none of the Warren Report’s evidence ever found anything the Commission missed; that he had found nothing since he took the Report to change his mind and that he had never changed his mind on their conclusions.

> Oswald was involved in some way in the assassination, if only as a fall guy. Some of the Dallas police force may have been involved, planted the evidence that implicated Oswald, and covered up the fact that there was a conspiracy. The medical examiner believed his own testimony to the Warren Commission, but later had doubts. The Commission found evidence of a conspiracy but didn’t believe it, so they covered it up in order to present it to the public. Later, at least one member of the Commission changed his mind, but he didn’t know what really did happen, so he decided to say nothing. So there was conspiracy in Dallas, and in Washington nothing worse than blundering.

I could say all this with certainty if I knew that stress always equals deception. Unfortunately, I do not know that. But the PSE analysis of the assassination tapes has generated a staggering amount of fresh doubt regarding the Warren Report. This doubt rises not only from specific points the PSE has called into question, but from the very sinister implications of the very existence of deception among policemen, government officials and Commission members. The question remains: did such deception exist or was the stress merely an outside issue?

In other words, even making some fairly conservative assumptions, there is a 94 percent chance that at least one of these men is lying.

*My own personal opinion?* I don’t know.  
I remember the person he talked about. He said he was wearing it, and he was, but he stressed. He stressed not because he was lying, but because there was something about that ring that really bothered him, something he didn’t want the world to know. Perhaps that is also true of these men who, in one way or another, learned some part of the truth about the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

I suppose I’m not absolutely sure even of that. When I first met Bob Smith of the Committee, I asked him if there was any one thing the government could do to clear up the mystery. Yes, he replied, the one thing that would help more than anything else would be to make available the physical evidence— the detailed FBI lab reports, the X-rays and autopsy photographs, the microscopic slides, the bloodstained clothing, yes, even the President’s brain, wherever it has been hidden. These things, he said, would go far toward answering the questions about what actually happened that day in Dallas. Maybe they would even confirm the Warren Report.

So when I say I’m not absolutely certain these men are concealing something, I mean I can think of something that could conceivably change my mind. That is, if the government would open all its files on this matter to us and prove that we are wrong—we, the people who ten years later still believe we haven’t yet heard the full account of the events of November 22, 1963.

Attachment to CIR-316/03107-73

**SUBJECT:** Conference of the Committee to Investigate Assassinations,  
**Report on Proceedings 23 November 1973**

1. The Committee to Investigate Assassinations claims to have been established in 1969. The headquarters are in Washington, D.C. (at 1520 16th Street, N.W.). In the four years of its existence the Committee has done research and has become a kind of clearing house for the study of assassinations. It maintains contact with other groups engaged in similar activity, of which there seem to be at least two, one of which is located in the Boston area.

2. In addition to research, the Committee acts to help individuals interested in the investigation of assassinations. It thus files suits for private persons demanding access to classified information. It sponsors the publication of books and articles relating to the field of its interest, and sponsors the production of movies. It publishes a newsletter.

3. The conference of November 23-24, 1973, is the first of its type to be held by the Committee. The Georgetown University was helpful by placing Gaston Hall at the disposal of the Committee free of charge. By agreement with the University, the Committee will also be able to use the services of the University Library as a repository and research center.

4. The Conference opened on November 23, 1973, with a delay of about half an hour. The delay may have been due to the installation of recording equipment which literally covered the premises with a tangle of wires of every kind. The *Washington Post* reports an attendance exceeding 300. This is a generous estimate. After deducting official speakers, recording personnel, and press representatives, the audience probably numbered no more than 150, if that many.

5. Beards and long hair prevailed, and others stood out like a sore thumb. There was not a single Negro in the audience, nor, that morning, on the platform. Even the speaker who spoke on the case of Martin Luther King was white.

6. Not all the speakers preannounced were present. The chairman announced the absence of Richard Sprague. Another speaker, a lawyer from Los Angeles whose name was drowned out in the noise, was also absent. They were replaced by Dr. Robert Forman and someone whose name sounded like "Ed Kirkley".

7. The chairman announced that all the speeches would be tape recorded for subsequent publication. He further invited the audience to attend movies to be shown that night. One of these, "Burn", was to be shown at the University. Others by prearrangement would be shown at local movie theaters. The latter were connected with the Kennedy assassination. The case of the President's murder was in the center of the conference and, as noted by one of the organizers (Smith), one half of the speakers were to center their attention upon the Oswald case.

8. The chairman adhered strictly to the program and every speaker mentioned in the program for the morning session of November 23 spoke as specified. Of those who spoke, Norman Mailer, Robert P. Smith and Ronald Van Doren deserve particular attention. Their speeches in summary are reviewed below.

9. A table at the back of the audience presented recommended literature. The books included H. Weissberg's *Whitewash* and Peter Noyes' *Legacy of Doubt*. For some reason there was a copy of one paper only, that of George O'Toole's *Assassination Tapes*. There was also a bibliography of political assassination; the foreword to which lists the persons most actively collaborating with the Committee.

10. A publication circulated during the conference was the November, 1973 issue of Computers and Automation which is to be renamed, starting January 1, 1974, Computers and People. The publication of articles such as "Nixon and the Mafia" which concludes that Richard M. Nixon seems to be the embodiment of a prediction that organized crime would someday put its own man in the White House, seems somewhat curious in a magazine devoted to the profession of data processing and the use of computers. The magazine was established in 1951 by Berkeley Enterprises in Massachusetts. Alger Hiss is among its contributors and an abundance of articles by Richard Sprague on the subject of Watergate published in the past year.

11. Another organization which received publicity at the Conference was The Committee for Action/Research on the Intelligence Community (CARIC).

12. A representative of Computers and Automation handed out this publication free of charge to members of the audience. He took notes with fantastic speed and apparent accuracy of everything said during the proceedings.

13. The lights gave out at one point and did not come on again during the morning session. The absence of current may have affected the tape recording.

14. The morning session, due to close at 12:30, ended after 1:30 p.m. By this time the audience was impatient to have lunch, and the resumption of the proceedings was therefore postponed to a later hour.

15. No document of any kind was issued to the persons who paid $15.00 to enter. Instead their hand was stamped with the name of the organization which gave them access to all further meetings that day and the next (the members of the audience were apparently not supposed to wash their hands during this time). Names were taken down, but no questions asked other than one's initial. No information on address, occupation, etc. was required.

16. **Speech by Norman Mailer.** This was beyond a doubt, the most striking presentation during the Friday morning session. Mailer spoke briefly and left the conference shortly after the speech.

17. Mailer said that political intelligence as a subject was as powerful as "peace". Interest in assassination is obsessive. The obsession arises from the fact that a solution to the problem is not found, and attention is constantly drawn back to the unanswerable question.

18. He said that we have here the most powerful nation in the world which cannot come to grips with a question which seems as amazingly simple as the Kennedy assassination. The result has been that this nation has decided to shut down investigation and has thus alienated itself from its own history. This alienation has brought apathy, a trait noticeable in the reaction to investigations which bring no wide response.

19. A nation which rejects its own history is on the path to a totalitarian regime. Facts, meanwhile, have a peculiar ability to change when they are investigated, and investigators must therefore rely upon hypothesis. The history of the last ten years has been made unendurable by the abundance of hypotheses. They range from the opinion that an assassination is an accident lacking any particular sequence to the hypothesis that secret police forces are engaging in a world conspiracy.

20. The present conference must help us to learn whether there are possibilities, and what possibilities exist, to solve these questions.

21. **Speech by Robert P. Smith.** Mr. Smith was described as the director of research of the Committee, but he seems to be one of the major motive forces in this organization.

22. Mr. Smith pointed out that he had spent the last three years studying the Kennedy case. Much research had been done, but nothing had changed, so far as practical action was concerned, in the last nine years.

27. **Speech by Ronald Van Doren**. Mr. Van Doren seems to be a follower of Governor Wallace. He began by commenting on the sad situation in a country with a judiciary where individuals have to make conjectures regarding a case as obvious as that of Bremer. There is no doubt that Bremer pulled the trigger. But one should examine the political situation at the time of his action. Wallace was by far the leading candidate in the election campaign, a threat to other candidates, and he was winning the nomination. He represented a challenge to both parties. Nothing he said could be interpreted as racist, and in the economic sense he carried wide appeal. The question which faced the other candidates was how he could be stopped from disrupting the two parties and from preventing the re-election of the President. History will show how he was stopped and why this occurred.

28. The case in defense of Wallace's civil rights was quietly dropped. No proper investigation was conducted. As usual in assassination cases there was a diary. It showed that Bremer was acting alone and was deranged. Read as a piece of literature, the diary presents Bremer as a non-person, an illiterate unable to spell. There is nothing regarding the people he worked with. Meanwhile, if one examines Bremer's background, he appears an entirely different person. Why did he travel repeatedly to Ottawa? How did he manage to carry guns on planes? What was he doing in New York? Why was he in Washington? And where did he get his funds? The apartment he rented exceeds his annual income. His mother could not afford to visit him in prison, yet he dressed well. With whom was he involved?

29. All this should be looked into. Watergate brought the electoral campaign to the fore. Why has discussion of the Bremer shooting been excluded from the investigation? Bremer was a part of the 1972 campaign, yet there is no mention of Wallace or of Bremer. Two years from now Wallace will be back.

30. **Speech by Ms. Meredith Rode**. Ms. Rode was very brief. She said she became interested in the killing of George Lincoln Rockwell in 1970, and that the case was built on circumstantial evidence exclusively. The case is still open, for the police believe that there was an accomplice. No funds are available for defense.

23. Although the National Archives are the repository for the Kennedy assassination documents, the FBI and the CIA are responsible for restricting research. Much of the 300 cubic feet of documents have been printed, a reclassification in 1971 has released 3,000 pages, and the CIA later released more, but none of the material released has created any sensation. The Freedom of Information Act is not as liberal on assassination material as on other matters. Some material was not even turned over to the Warren Commission. The FBI and the Justice Department are alone in knowing the results of some tests.

24. In the non-governmental area, much has been published, and the book by Peter Noyes must be singled out particularly.

25. Speech by Mr. Robert Hanson. Mr. Hanson has become the counsel for Sirhan Sirhan. He studied to become an engineer and then shifted to law. (To judge from the number of cases which he says he has lost, he should have remained an engineer instead of becoming an attorney.)

   Mr. Hanson said that the Sirhan case is pretty hopeless. The trial was based on a 100 percent belief in Sirhan's guilt. Therefore important witnesses were not called, and no attention was paid to ballistics. Scientific study, however, indicates that Sirhan Sirhan may not even have been the person who committed the crime. But even if it is proved that his gun did not kill Robert Kennedy, this discovery may have no influence upon Sirhan's case. California officials have no desire to reopen the case and funds to handle the proceedings are lacking. A book by Tiger on the case is worthy of note. Tiger claims that Sirhan Sirhan was acting under hypnotic influence.

26. Speech by James Lesar. Mr. Lesar, who spoke on the Martin Luther King assassination, declared that Ray was innocent, and that the FBI and the Justice Department were responsible for wrongly solving the crime. Ray was framed by conspirators. The persons presently involved in Watergate played a role in the Ray case investigation. No private agency - only a government agency - can solve the Ray case. All depends on whether the judiciary acts honestly or with political consideration in mind. As it stands today, we see Ray's rights having been abominably violated; we see lawyers who did not do their job; and we see nothing approaching an open hearing.

# ANNOUNCEMENT

Senator John Stennis, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, will begin hearings early in the New Year on his Bill No. S.2597 -- to amend the National Security Act -- in regard to clarification of the authority of the CIA.

The bill recently introduced by Senator Stennis resulted in part from correspondence with Senator Edmund Muskie, Chairman of the Senate Disarmament Subcommittee. To some degree, these hearings were inspired by the Watergate developments.

People with knowledge in the areas which might be fruitful for investigation should be in touch with Senator Stennis' Committee. For further information, contact the Task Force For A Nuclear Test Ban, Betty Lall and Jo Pomerance, Co-Chairmen, care of the Project on Budget Priorities, 1620 Eye Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20006.

Who knows what future political espionage will occur under the guise of so-called "national security" or loyalty to an administration? Only time will tell, but through diligence and your help CARIC will anticipate and bring to your attention situations within the government that are likely to produce a new "Watergate."

Although CARIC does believe that a massive government spy apparatus is at work in the world, we hope to dispel some of the paranoia citizens naturally feel when there is talk of spies and wiretaps. We know that the FBI does not have agents behind every tree, but there are agents in every major community in this country who have spied on innocent private and public citizens. Only a full and undisguised look into this hidden world can dispel unwarranted fears, and guide the public effort to end this illegal and unjustified espionage. The secrecy with which the government surrounds itself must end.

CARIC knows that tens of thousands of American citizens from all walks of life were mobilized over the past decade to help bring an end to the government's war in Indochina - a war that has taken new forms under the direction of U.S. Intelligence agencies. CARIC hopes that these same concerned citizens will continue to oppose the policies of our government which bring this new form of covert war and the Watergate scandals. It is now time for thousands of Americans to mobilize to stop the spying as we stopped the dying. Please join us in our effort.

## THE COMMITTEE FOR ACTION/RESEARCH ON THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY (CARIC)

### INTELLIGENCE REPORT

### CARIC ORGANIZATION
CARIC is organized to reflect the operating procedures of a typical intelligence organization. Our research process involves collecting information from a wide variety of sources both public and private. Our analysis is the collective product of CARIC participants and eliminates any compartmentalization of knowledge. The information and our analysis is then disseminated through CARIC publications and separate works by CARIC participants. In addition, CARIC provides information to other journalists and qualified researchers.

---

### INTELLIGENCE DOCUMENTATION CENTER (IDC)
CARIC is continuously collecting information on intelligence from a variety of sources including official government publications and documents, powered by investigations, public hearings, and reports conducted with hundreds of former intelligence and police agents. The information informs the data-base of the Intelligence Documentation Center maintained by CARIC. The IDC is a library of information on U.S. intelligence available upon request to journalists, qualified researchers and members of CARIC.

### SPEAKERS BUREAU AND WORKSHOPS
CARIC maintains a listing of members available to speak before groups on a variety of subjects ranging from the foreign intelligence programs of our government to the problems of criminal justice in this country. Our speakers include former intelligence workers, police agents and informers and others familiar with American intelligence. CARIC will periodically conduct workshops for church, labor, school or community organizations. Workshop topics include:
- OPERATION PHOENIX - CIA assassination in Vietnam
- SALEM HOUSE - Preparation for the coup in Cambodia
- The CIA in Laos
- OPERATION BOULDER - An introduction to the next American war
- Right-wing terrorism in America
- Federal Financing for civil disturbances: Riots and Demonstrations
- The Internal Security apparatus and Watergate

---

### MULTI-MEDIA BRIEFING
CARIC will soon augment our workshops with a multi-media briefing on U.S. intelligence featuring films, video tapes, displays and recorded interviews. The exhibit will dramatically illustrate intelligence as practiced by our government. Our hope is to create a super-conscious realization by our audience of the concepts presented in this display. The first element of the multi-media briefing is a slide show tracing the growth of the internal security apparatus of our government and demonstrating how this apparatus influenced the Watergate scandal. The slide show terminates with suggestions for limiting future growth of the internal security apparatus.

# THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY:  
## THE APPLICATION OF COMPUTERS TO THE PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE  
by  
Richard E. Sprague  
Hartsdale, New York  

---

### Part 1. Introduction  
#### Who Assassinated President Kennedy?  

On November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas, President John F. Kennedy, while riding in an open limousine through Dealey Plaza and waving to the surrounding crowds, was shot to death. Lee Harvey Oswald, an ex-Marine, and former visitor to the Soviet Union, was arrested that afternoon in a movie theater in another section of Dallas; that night he was charged with shooting President Kennedy from the sixth floor eastermost window of the Texas School Book Depository Building overlooking Dealey Plaza. This act Oswald denied steadily through two days of questioning (no record of questions and answers was preserved). Two days later while Oswald was being transferred from one jail to another, he was shot by Jack Ruby, the Dallas night-club owner, in the basement of the Dallas police station, while millions of Americans watched on television. The commission of investigation, appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson, and headed by Chief Justice Earl Warren of the U.S. Supreme Court, published its report in September 1964, and concluded that Oswald was the sole assassin and that there was no conspiracy.  

> "In view of the authority of the Warren Commission, that conclusion was accepted by many Americans for a long time. But the conclusion cannot be considered the crucial evidence — such as the physics of the shooting, the timing of a number of events, and other important and undeniable facts. In other words, Oswald was not the sole assassin, and there was a conspiracy."

This article will develop that thesis, prove it to be true on the basis of substantial, conclusive evidence, and in particular some analysis of the photographic evidence.  

There was in fact a conspiracy. Oswald played a role in the conspiracy, although there is conclusive evidence that on November 22, 1963, he did no shooting at President Kennedy, and that, just as he claimed when he was in the Dallas jail, he was a "patsy." At least three gunmen (and probably four) — none of whom were in the sixth floor eastermost window of the Texas School Book Depository building where the Warren Commission placed Oswald — fired a total of six shots at President Kennedy.  

One of these shots missed entirely; one hit Governor John B. Connally, Jr. of Texas, riding with Kennedy; and four hit President Kennedy, one in his throat, one in his back, and two in his head. (The bulk of the undeniable evidence for these statements about the shots consists of:  
(a) the physics of the motions of Kennedy and Connally shown in some 60 frames of the famous film by Abraham Zapruder; (b) the locations of the injuries in Kennedy and in Connally; and (c) more than 100 photographs and more than 70 frames of movies.)  

More than 50 persons were involved in the conspiracy at the time of firing the shots. These persons included members of the Dallas police force (but not all of the Dallas police — and that ac-

# THE PURSUIT OF IMPORTANT TRUTH

The magazine **Computers and Automation** has for more than three years followed an unusual publication policy:

- The pursuit of truth in input, output, and processing, for the benefit of people,
and an unusual belief:

  - That computers are too important to be left to computer experts and must be integrated into a socially responsible profession of information engineering.

Where this policy has operated most is in publishing information, articles, and reports on subjects which a great many liberal and progressive newspapers and periodicals have left unexplored or unmentioned:

- The political conspiracies which have led to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King, and others – and their coverups
- The conspiracies, coverups, and lies in connection with the pursuit of war in Indochina and dictatorship by the Saigon regime
- The connections of President Richard M. Nixon with organized crime and the Mafia
- The Watergate crimes

If you believe in the value of truthful, frank reporting on the most important topics for the welfare of the people of the United States today, we urge you to subscribe to our magazine, and buy our back copies (almost every one is in print), please help us pursue the important truth and report on it, by buying our products.

*Edmund C. Berkeley, Editor*

**Unsettling, Disturbing, Critical ...**

Computers and Automation, established 1951 and therefore the oldest magazine in the field of computers and data processing, believes that the profession of information engineer includes not only competence in handling information using computers and other means, but also a broad responsibility, in a professional and engineering sense, for:

- The reliability and social significance of pertinent input data;
- The social value and truth of the output results.

In the same way, a bridge engineer takes a professional responsibility for the reliability and significance of the data he uses, and the safety and efficiency of the bridge he builds, for human beings to risk their lives on.

Accordingly, **Computers and Automation** publishes from time to time articles and other information related to socially useful input and output of data systems in a broad sense. To this end we seek to publish what is unsettling, disturbing, critical — but productive of thought and an improved and smarter "house" for all humanity, an earth in which our children and their generations may have a future, instead of facing extinction.

The professional information engineer needs to relate his engineering to the most important and most serious problems in the world today: war, nuclear weapons, pollution, the population explosion, and many more.

## The Understanding of Natural Language by Computers

**Proposition:** Computers are making long strides towards understanding natural language as used by human beings, and will eventually understand such language as well as many human beings do. 

**What do we mean by:** computers? understanding language? natural language? And what is the evidence for this proposition? 

---

The word "computers" here refers to powerful computers that have appropriate programs written by human beings plus the programmed capacity to improve their programs by using experience. An example of such improvement is Dr. A. L. Samuels' famous checker-playing program, which can learn from experience, and which plays far better checkers than Dr. Samuels himself can play. 

The experience may consist of the following at least:

- Answers from human beings to questions posed by the computer;
- Differences between computed results and a priori specified results;
- Signals from the environment, such as instrument readings;
- Information obtained by “looks” at the environment, as for example recognition of the character A, as in optical character recognition;
- The interpretation of words, as with FORTRAN expressions.

Probably there are even more categories of experience which a powerful computer program can use to modify itself to become even a better program.

In regard to “understanding language,” there are over 300 languages which computers have been programmed to understand, when written precisely according to stated rules: among them, BASIC, FORTRAN, COBOL, many kinds of machine language, etc.

**“Natural language”** is the ordinary language used by human beings, subject to the requirement that a computer implicit understanding must be stated. For example, when a speaker exclaims “Ouch!”, a great deal of the meaning comes from the listener’s observations of the speaker. But a computer, like a blind man, cannot “see” the situation, and must be told more than the ordinary listener. 

With some definitions taken care of, let us consider evidence for the main proposition stated above. This evidence includes the information published in several recent articles in *Computers and Automation*.

The article “‘Do What I Mean’ — The Programmer’s Assistant”, by Warren Teitelman, in the April 1972 issue, described a “programmer’s assistant”, called “DWIM”; this was a “front end” or preprocessor to an interactive program for operating with LISP expressions. The front end was tolerant of the programmer’s mistakes in typing, in low-precision situations, and where an error might occur, it would inquire of the human programmer what he meant, suggesting the correctly spelled alternative, and so on. In this way the human programmer was relieved of much of the burden of expressing himself exactly and correctly the first time, and his efficiency in using the LISP interactive program greatly increased. 

The three articles “Computer Programming Using Natural Language” by Edmund C. Berkeley, Andy Langer, and Casper Otten, in the June, July, and August 1973 issues, demonstrated the understanding by a computer program called GENIE of at least some sets of instructions in ordinary natural language. The vocabulary though small was free; and there was unlimited freedom in putting the words together, with about a 90% chance of complete understanding. The computer program that did this could be called 15% GENIE, because, as the authors emphasized, it was still in an early stage of development.

The article “Latest Computers See, Hear, Speak, and Sing — and May Outhink Man” by David Brand, in the October 1973 issue, enumerated many instances of computers (and robots equipped with computers) which could deal with concepts expressed in natural language. One of the programs mentioned could for example decipher natural language commands dealing with the stacking of blocks of various shapes, sizes, and colors.

The main tasks for understanding natural language appear to be the following:

1. Recognition of the framework of a sentence;
2. Recognition of the common meaning of groups of synonyms, the collection of words that “say the same thing”;
3. Knowledge of context: the context is regularly specified to the computer, so that it does not have to deduce the context from “what is being said”;
4. Knowledge of a limited vocabulary consisting of perhaps 300 to 500 words — knowledge in the sense that the computer program can attach meaning to the words either by themselves or in phrases, as for example it may attach the meaning of doing something three times to the numeral 3;
5. Capacity to accept variation in the way something is stated by a human programmer.

The three articles referred to above show instances of the achievement of all of these tasks separately. Combining all the achievements should not be too hard, especially since children as young as four years old show complete capacities to listen to many kinds of natural language, understand, and respond.

### 8 REASONS TO BE INTERESTED IN THE FIELD OF COMMON SENSE, WISDOM, AND GENERAL SCIENCE

1. **COMPUTERS** are important -  
   But the computer field is over 25 years old. Here is a field where you can get in on the ground floor to make your mark.

2. **MATHEMATICS** is important -  
   But this field is more important than mathematics, because common sense, wisdom, and general science have more applications.

3. **WISDOM** is important -  
   This field can be reasonably called "the engineering of wisdom."

4. **COMMON SENSE** is important -  
   This field includes the systematic study and development of common sense.

5. **SCIENCE** is important -  
   This field includes what is common to all the sciences, what is generally true and important in the sciences.

6. **MISTAKES** are costly and to be AVOIDED -  
   This field includes the systematic study of the prevention of mistakes.

7. **MONEY** is important -  
   The systematic prevention of mistakes in your organization might save 10 to 20% of its expenses per year.

8. **OPPORTUNITY** is important -  
   If you enter or renew your subscription to both *Computers and Automation* and *The Notebook on Common Sense* at the same time, direct to us, - you may take off $2.00 per year from the total cost.

# Cooperative Facilities to Obtain the Advantages of Computers

Michael J. Cerullo  
Asst. Professor of Accounting  
State Univ. of New York at Albany  
1400 Washington Ave.  
Albany, N.Y. 12222  

*"Because of general dissatisfaction, 30% of the surveyed service bureau clients planned to discontinue using service bureaus."*

## Computer Use

A recent study of 2,500 companies conducted by the Research Institute of America, revealed that 55% of the firms regularly use computers in conducting their business. Further breakdown of the study shows that an average of 32% own or lease their own computers, and 23% use an outside service bureau for processing data.¹

While a majority of the companies surveyed do use computers in some form, a significant 45% of the respondents do not use any type of computerized data processing service. Those companies cited the following reasons for not using computers:²

| Reasons for Not Using Computers            | Per Cent |
|--------------------------------------------|----------|
| Operation too small                        | 50       |
| Looked into and tabled for the present    | 31       |
| Present methods satisfactory                | 21       |
| Plan to install a computer within a year   | 8        |
| Want to begin using a service bureau within a year | 1      |
| Other                                      | .13      |
| Total (multiple answers)                   | 166%     |

## Service Bureau Use

In addition to the non-users, another recent study revealed that most service bureau clients are not effectively using their service bureau and, as a result, are receiving few, if any, of the advantages of electronic data processing (EDP). Most of the surveyed service bureau clients were:³

1. Receiving routine services which do not save them money.
2. Not planning to expand into more sophisticated, higher-payoff applications.
3. Not receiving indirect benefits and savings, such as improved information for decision making.
4. Not satisfied with current services.

The study also disclosed that because of the general dissatisfaction, 30% of the surveyed service bureau clients planned to discontinue using service bureaus and purchase in-house computers.⁴

## Cooperative Service Bureaus

Both non-users and dissatisfied service bureau clients, therefore, offer a ready market for a newer approach to obtaining the advantages of EDP — the formation of a cooperative service bureau. A cooperative service bureau consists of several sponsoring firms who jointly own a computer and share in its operating costs at a much lower expense than individual ownership of a computer. If carefully planned before operations begin, a cooperative service bureau will provide its sponsors with all the advantages of EDP plus many other advantages unique to jointly-shared facilities and personnel.

Among these additional advantages are:

1. The sponsors would purchase a computer tailored to their specific needs.
2. They would have exclusive use of the computer.
3. Their computer would be available for use at any time.
4. They could share the costs of any computer programs developed.
5. They could share the costs of any package or canned computer programs purchased.
6. They would have available for their exclusive use a staff of data processing experts and a computer — at a fraction of the cost of individual ownership.

## Factors Insuring the Success of the Cooperative

The first step in forming a successful cooperative service bureau is to enroll an appropriate number of companies. Ideally, the cooperative should be limited to five or six sponsoring firms. A larger number may create unmanageable problems involving operations, communications, control, scheduling of computer time, and so forth. A smaller number may make the venture economically unfeasible.

# Lack of Interest

At the present time, widespread lack of interest in joining a cooperative is more of a problem to potential organizers than too much demand. The author contacted a number of public accounting firms and found that three firms had already made such an attempt could not interest enough firms to join. Their comments were:

- We tried to organize one several years ago; the firms contacted were not interested.
  
- We would like to explore this possibility but we can't get anyone else interested.

- At present there appears to be a tragic lack of interest locally by other CPA firms.

> **Suggestion:** A possible reason for the lack of interest is a misunderstanding of the true nature of a cooperative. Interested companies must therefore be prepared to sell the idea to others. As more published material becomes available in the field, this problem should be alleviated.

## Confidential Information

A second major reason for lack of interest is that companies fear for the control and security of their confidential or sensitive information. Such fear is certainly legitimate and underscores the need for a cooperative that is to be successful, to devise an adequate system for both control and security. A committee responsible for such a system should be established at the outset by the sponsoring firms.

### Protection

One of its duties should be to adequately safeguard the sponsors' records and documents against fire, theft, water, and other hazards and disasters. Statistics compiled by the Sales Manufacturers National Association show that about one-half of companies whose important records and documents were destroyed through some catastrophe never resumed business or were permanently closed down within six months; an additional 13% suffered serious economic impairment and were unable to remain in business only several weeks. For this reason, the quality control and security custodian must see that the cooperative service bureau maintains:

- Protective devices
- Fireproof vaults
- Adequate insurance to cover loss of important client records or documents

The committee must also take measures to prevent one client’s records from becoming commingled with another client’s records – a not-unlikely occurrence in such an environment.

## Preventing Disclosure

Finally, the committee should determine how to prevent disclosure of confidential information. For example, no member of any sponsoring company should be allowed in certain strategic parts of the computer center. Likewise, each company's records should be coded and the code number known only to key computer center personnel. In cases requiring almost security, the actual processing of data should be monitored by a key employee of the computer center or possibly by a representative of a disinterested third party, such as a firm of independent public accountants.

# Sharing of Expenses: Startup Costs

With an adequate number of sponsoring firms lined up and a sound security system worked out, the necessity in establishing a successful cooperative is to determine methods of sharing the expenses. There are two categories of costs to consider:

1. **Startup costs.** These include all costs incurred prior to the time that the cooperative commences operations. Startup costs are either directly traceable to a particular firm or are joint or common to all firms. An example of a direct cost would be that of analyzing, modifying, and redesigning of systems prior to conversion to the computer. An example of a joint or common cost would be the cost of computer supervision, including conditioning, engineering supervision, false floors, ducts and pipes, transformers or motor generators, cabling and wiring, and overhead racks and supports.

   Each sponsoring firm should pay for its own direct costs. Joint costs should be shared equally or apportioned among the firms according to some equitable formula.

2. **Operating costs.** These include the monthly hardware and software costs to operate the cooperative. Hardware costs refer to the periodic rental or purchase charge for the computer equipment. As a minimum, the computer equipment consists of an input unit, a central processing unit, and an output unit. Software costs include personnel costs, programming costs, testing and debugging costs, magnetic tapes, disc packs, punched cards, equipment fees, pair parts, power, telecommunication lines, and so on.

   Operating costs that are directly traceable should be paid by the using firm. Joint or common costs can be shared equally or can be allocated to each firm based on the number of transactions processed or the actual computer processing time used during the period. In addition, if so desired, a sponsor could be required to pay a minimum or maximum monthly charge.

## Management

Fourthly, the sponsoring companies should decide how to manage the venture. It is advisable to form a committee to oversee the management and operation of the cooperative. A decision must be made whether each member regardless of size should have one vote or whether another basis of voting should be used. This decision should assure participants that no one firm will dominate or control the cooperative.

# Common Line of Business

A factor not to be overlooked when forming a cooperative, one which will avoid frustrations, complications, and extra expenses, is to see that each member is in the same industry or business category. Thus all sponsoring firms will have similar operating problems that can be simultaneously solved by the computer personnel, resulting in the allocation of smaller costs to each firm for each problem solved. Also computer programs developed or packaged programs purchased can be shared by all sponsors with minimum modifications, thus resulting in considerable programming cost savings.

# Control in Time-Sharing Systems

Fermín Caro del Castillo  
6043 Westridge Lane  
Fort Worth, Texas 76116  

*"A time-sharing installation (like every computer environment) is exposed to the seven major dangers: fire, water, theft, fraud, sabotage, equipment malfunctions, and human errors."*

---

## Introduction

This article has as its main objective to furnish and define some methods and provisions for control and security in a computer time-sharing environment.

It is evident that computer time-sharing has become very popular during recent years. More and more confidential information is being handled by these systems, creating an urgent need for strong measures of control and security.

## Description of the System

The service provided by a single computer to many telecommunications terminals has been called "computer time-sharing." With this type of service each user shares simultaneously in the processing capabilities of the central processor. This new computer facility makes this service available to small companies and/or other users who have little need for their own computer.

Computing services that may go under the heading of time-sharing include:

- Commercial computing: text editing; databank information retrieval services; application services such as colleges' records, inventory control, payrolls of small companies, and accounts receivable; administrative messages; and teaching and collection services; and more.

Among the great number of time-sharing users are hospitals (Wexford Hospital, one of the largest in Europe, has acquired the large ICL 1904S computer with 200 terminals), banks (Gosbank, the National Bank of the USSR, has ordered several large-scale Honeywell series 600 with 100 terminals), school and colleges (British schools and colleges have started using terminals), airlines (Continental Airlines uses the Sonic 360 reservation system with 550 online terminals).

## Trends

The growth in computer time-sharing has been phenomenal in recent years in spite of a short business recession between 1970 and 1972. Time sharing was a broker's dream in the '60s; many companies realized its potential, entered the market, and failed because of: one, strong competitive pressure, and two, because of the countless thefts and violations suffered. The highly competitive situation benefited the user in regard to pricing, but the offsetting consequence of lower profits caused a high casualty rate among these companies. As a result, the number of time-sharing firms dropped from 150 to 50 between 1969 and 1972.

## Technological Advances

Most important technological advances have been achieved recently on on-line terminals linked to central processors. Some of the improvements include modified state keyboards offering greater reliability and lower cost; visual display methods that incorporate more capacity, economy, and ease; and highly practical non-impact printing techniques, which operate faster, quieter and more reliable options; improved lower cost memory; more powerful logic capability; and faster and more accurate procedures and improvements in central processor software.

This is only the beginning. It is foreseen that in the future the equipment itself will change in nature and will probably not be recognizable as terminals per se. Rather, terminals will be modular systems consisting of the required input/output functions for specific jobs, built around basic controller and communication interfaces; in many instances, terminals will become special purpose devices.

## Hazards

A time-sharing installation, like every computer environment, is exposed to the seven major dangers of fire, water, theft, fraud, sabotage, EDP equipment malfunctions, and human errors. Fire is considered to be the greatest threat to magnetic tapes. Water does not constitute an important hazard to magnetic tapes, but it does to computer installa-

# Security Concerns and Protection Measures

Thefts, fraud, sabotage, EDP equipment malfunctions, and human errors are considered the most dangerous.

---

**Line-terminals connected to central processors**  
Remote points are more exposed to violations and thefts. The increasing popularity of time-sharing systems among large corporations and service bureaus has given rise to even more potential security breaches. Data transmitted over a communication line could be subject to wire tapping and a number of other hazards such as piggyback entry, where the intruder intercepts and compromises communication between a terminal and the processor while a legitimate user is inactive but still holding the line open. The intruder can even cancel the user's sign-off signal and gain control over it. A knowledgeable person could enter exchanges from a terminal and play havoc with the system.

## Need for Protection

Due to the increasing popularity of computing services, the issue of control and security protection has become more important. It is evident that the sharing systems present even obstacles to unauthorized parties. The security problem has been made critical by the growing number of computer users and by the fading of the means of time-sharing systems; no more protection exists than telephone conversations or Morse-coded methods, since the technological skills necessary for intercepting data are widespread. More and more companies are placing security issues in front of their firms' staff to central security matters. Trade organizations such as the American Management Association and the Bank Administration Institute, among others, and research firms such as Advance Management Research, Inc. find that seminars on computer security are conducted by data processing managers and security officers from business and government.

## Target of Attack

Computers have become an important source of information and, as a result, the target of many attacks. Some of the general information targets for industrial espionage are sales and service information, market analysis strategies, product information, stockholder information, legal documents, developmental plans, personnel changes, payroll data, general administrative matters; and the list could be expanded even more.

### Accidents

The case of an 18-year-old Cincinnati youth who used long-distance telephone to tap the lines of a time-sharing system firm in Louisville, Kentucky, and extracted data from its ledgers, as well as records of its customers, is representative of the type of risk to which computer installations are exposed. 

Accidents can have serious consequences such as the incident in which income tax return records for a nearby airport in Austin, Texas, were erased by energy emitted from the radar of a nearby airport.

## Safeguards

It is important to consider that too much control and too many security safeguards can become bothersome and costly. The measures to protect data from unauthorized access vary from one system to another. According to Richard F. Cross, Security Office for the Bank of New York, security systems should include each of the following segments: physical security; personnel security; procedural security; audit control; insurance; and any needed interfacing.

The quality and level of protection required depends on the sensitivity of the data being handled. Nevertheless, control and security in a time-sharing environment should encompass the whole system, since it is well known that even the strongest control measures can be violated at the weakest point. These measures should be taken in the central processing unit, software, personnel, communication lines, the terminal, and its users.

## Methods and Provisions — Central Processing Unit

The central processor is threatened mostly by sabotage, fire, water, theft, EDP equipment malfunctions, human accidental errors and environmental problems.

At the computer center of any company is the heart of the organization, and protection of the system against these threats can be provided by a carefully planned computer room. Luis Sosa, President of Data Processing Security, Inc., recommends that the computer center be located out of the main traffic areas. It must be fireproof, dustfree, and waterproof and provided with temperature and humidity controls. Water lines should not run through the computer room. A separate, fireproof storage area should be provided for data files, documentation, and operating supplies. It should also have alarm devices sensitive to magnetic, humidity, heat, pressure, dust, theft, power blackout, etc. There should be secured areas, fire monitors, personnel identification (visual, voice print, fingerprint, badge, passwords, etc.), well-planned maintenance service, and a number of extra provisions for protection.

Data Processing Security, Inc. has developed, for high security necessities, an electronically operated double door entry system for access control into the computer room. When a person enters the buffer zone, the door locks behind him while he is subjected to electronic search. If something is detected, the system freezes and automatically alerts security personnel. The second door can be opened only with a special badge key.

As such an advanced (sic) fire extinguishing system, as shown on the installed at the Chase Manhattan Bank's New York City headquarters, should be built. Engineered by Walter Kidding & Co., Inc., this system uses a battery of remotely located cylinder detectors, the gas discharges and builds up an inert atmosphere in the immediately surrounding area, extinguishing the fire without damaging equipment or data files. Employees can go back to work within five minutes after the fire has been put out and the ventilation systems restarted.

Another fire-fighting system, which has been developed by the Ansul Company uses Halon extinguishing agents, which are discharged in the form of a colorless, odorless, and non-toxic gas. Since Halon agents do not work by diluting oxygen, they are well-suited for areas where humans are present.

The Guaranty Bank and Trust Co. of Worcester, Mass., has adopted another approach to fire-fighting, a system installed by Security Control Systems which detects fire, smoke and excessive temperatures and humidity fluctuations and causes a monitoring to ensure early detection.

# Reporting Device to Alert Four Pre-Selected Phone Numbers for Help

## Software
Protection of data files, whether in the form of punch cards, magnetic tapes, or discs, is the key element in any computer facility.

Some specific examples of software security control measures are audit trails, access regulations, strong supervision of computer operators, the use and control of programs utilizing program documentation methods, the use of a log for all significant events (such as user identification, file use and attempts of unauthorized use), regulations to prevent unauthorized personnel from browsing through the files, and the use of a semi-automatic data inventory control system.

## Personnel
Physical control of access to the system is advisable. Note that this does not mean "employees only"; this implies careful screening of employees, replacement, and visitors to determine which of them should be allowed this proximity to the system. Intimately involved with time-sharing installations are three types of personnel: operators, programmers, and maintenance engineers.

According to Dennis Van Tassel, mathematician and head programmer at San Jose State College, all operators must understand that there exists a protection philosophy. If personnel are expected to help enforce and comply with this protection philosophy, it must be clearly defined and specified.

It is advisable to use the following provisions for personnel control: control of logs and records, division of responsibilities, rotation of duties, adequate supervision to reduce the risk of losses caused by accident or error, careful handling of data files, cleanliness regulations, control access to private files, and appropriate instruction in case of disasters.

## Terminals
Some of the most common pitfalls encountered when using terminals are frequent communication interruptions, risk of communication interception, difficult access control, and noisy lines.

The greatest disadvantages of time-sharing services are those in connection with the communication lines which link the terminals to the central processing unit. Telephone lines are designed for voice communication rather than data communication, and the results have been that lines are too noisy and have too many interruptions for appropriate handling of data communication.

There have been some recent developments in the improvement of data transmissions. Bell System has developed its Digital Data Service (DDS), a data transmission system which has been introduced early this year in five cities: New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, and Chicago; and, by the end of 1974, twenty-four cities are expected to have it. Bell further plans to provide continuous monitoring of their DDS channels. When errors of transmission are detected, DDS will notify the customer. Decision on retransmission will be the customer's responsibility. Another development in data communication is DUV (data under voice). By late 1973 this technique will be in service between New York and Chicago; consequently, communication problems should become virtually nonexistent within the near future, and this system will become even more popular.

Telephone lines are vulnerable to three types of security problems: wire tapping, piggyback, and user's sign-off signal cancellation. These common threats may be avoided by the use of a privacy transformation method (also called scramblers or cryptographic techniques). This is a non-singular (reversible) operation which conceals the original message either by the substitution of new characters, rearrangement of the characters, or by the adding of strings of digits to the original message.

Some new techniques for encrypting data have evolved, such as high speed transmission and signal scrambling. In spite of all of these techniques, it is still possible to intercept and tap the information. According to Tuckerman, unauthorized users (intruders) who possess on limited materials and information with which to work, can readily extract the original text of expected, capacity, and computational abilities of the computer.

## Access Control
Access to the system throughout the communication lines should be controlled by the central processing unit and by the user's own procedures. This is possible by cryptographic and similar techniques, personnel relocation, or by deciphering and deciphering hardware.

Computer software packages have been written to expedite data transmissions. Ciphering software is an interactive technique because it can be done automatically by the program which creates the data and at a very low cost. Only programs using the ciph- ering technique are able to use this data. These special hardware cipher devices can be located at the terminal and at the computer to protect transmitted data.

Scramblers or voice privacy devices are currently being used by large corporations as such a security measure, and it is said to be an industry as well as by union representatives during contract negotiation time. (Scrambler phones are currently in 20 to 30 million dollar business, including law enforcement and military purchases). Scrambler devices are now being built for time-sharing operations. These devices offer protection similar to encryption. Scramblers convert data into something resembling channel noise or a malfunctioning circuit.

Other features for terminals include print inhibit, security keylock, operator identification card reader, and the use of a terminal identifier. With print inhibit, the terminal operator can enter data, such as security passwords, without its being physically displayed. A physical keylock can be attached to the terminal which will not allow the entry of data. The operator identification card reader reads magnetically encoded information on a magnetic strip card. The card can be used to supply the user's password and/or name.

Direct access device security features include file mask, volume detection, and write-exhibit switch. The file mask controls or allows read-only access.

## Insurance

If data security measures fail, the use of EDP (Electronic Data Processing) can back-up or soften the blow. Every manager or person who has an in-house computer, or serves as a user of a service bureau, or transmits data to a client should be computer-security conscious. Insurance is one of the back-up answers if prevention fails. However, not all insurers can afford or even need an elaborate and comprehensive security system; thus, evaluation of the information becomes necessary to determine those elements of the system which require this protection.

The subject matter of ordinary insurance coverage is physical damage to tangible property. In this case, hardware and data are not covered. Business interruption insurance protects against the loss of income due to fire or other interruptions to normal business but does not cover the consequences. Boiler explosion and other exclusionary insurance that hedges mishaps do not cover computer operations. Theft and employee dishonesty are also insured in terms of general valuable papers and records’ coverage protection as noted and account receivable protection. It does not include such computer media as valuable records. Public liability insurances involve the company for acts or omissions of acts which give rise to claims by outsiders against the company.

Insurance can prevent an unfortunate event from becoming a catastrophe. When a person buys an insurance policy, he knows that he will be indemnified if loss does occur.

Some of the insurance companies which write EDP policies are the Saint Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co., Insurance Company of North America, The Insurance Co., and Royal Assurance of America.

Insurance premiums generally correspond to the regular fire policy rates plus an added loading factor for the additional EDP perils.

Indubitably any computer installation, regardless of the quality and level of its security system, should approach the issue of risk loss. Security is based on a cost-benefit concept; either words the cost of violating the system should be greater than the gain derived therefrom.

## Procedure for Withdrawal

Sixth, a procedure should be established for withdrawal from the cooperative. If the withdrawing firm has not been a member for a predetermined time, perhaps one or two years, a sliding scale penalty for withdrawal should be established.

## Procedure for Admission

Finally, procedures must be determined to govern the admission of new members into the cooperative. Perhaps a unanimous restriction by the current members should be required to admit a new member. The current members should also decide if a newly admitted member should pay a predetermined portion of the cooperative's startup costs and if the cooperative should limit membership to firms of the same approximate size as current members.

## Conclusion

With due care taken in following the above steps, establishing a successful cooperative service bureau should be relatively easy. Companies would be well advised to consider the idea seriously, for cooperative service bureaus offer a visible and in many ways superior alternative to the more costly in-house computer and the less satisfactory outside service bureau.

# Alienation and the Systems Analyst

**Alan E. Brill**

“Systems analysts ... must be seen as full-fledged members of the firm.”

## A Wall of Managerial Attitudes

In most large organizations, the systems and data processing departments are separated from the rest of the firm by a wall of managerial attitudes. While employees in most jobs are encouraged to gain a wide variety of experience in various departments as they rise through various management levels, it is rare that a systems analyst or a programmer is given an equal opportunity. The general attitude is "He's a computer man, not a manager (or a businessman, or a banker). He wouldn't fit in. Besides, he's doing a good job where he is."

As a result, the analyst has exactly no motivation to think of himself as an insurance man or a businessman, or a banker, or an accountant. He is made to feel like a consultant. He can serve the organization, but he isn't free to move within it. To make matters worse, some firms rotate the people in their management development programs through a stint in the systems department. It is little wonder that there is a high turnover in systems analysts. The company does very little to make him feel like a member of the family.

## Potential Source of Talent

But beyond the problems brought about by the personal turbulence, the firm is grooming a potential source of fine managerial talent. Many analysts joining major corporations hold degrees as Master, Business Administration. Their educational backgrounds, when combined with their ability to objectively define problems and see solutions, and the detailed working knowledge of the company gained in 

the system design process, should put them in the management spotlight. Instead, the system analyst finds that he has been given the indelible label of "computer person" and that his upward mobility is limited to the systems department. As a result, systems analysts leave the firm, and often leave the systems profession.

## Experience in Systems

As businesses come more and more to depend upon data processing to support their operations, it will be desirable for a significant number of management team members to have experience in systems. Yet, by their actions, managements have forced many talented people to avoid beginning their careers in data processing for fear of becoming stereotyped.

So it would seem that a number of the problems that businesses face in their systems activities are a result of a regrettable but widespread management attitude.

Only when systems analysts are regarded as having a potential for advancement to positions in general management, and are given an equal chance to rise in the organization, will the systems man lose his alienation and see himself as a member of the company team.

# Strategy and Action on World Trade

**James H. Binger, Chairman**  
Honeywell Inc.  
2701 Fourth Ave. S.  
Minneapolis, Minn. 55408  

*"What we [the United States] have is a little corner of the world, and we must find a way to live in it harmoniously with our neighbors, many of whom are every bit as good as we are at almost everything we do."*

The theme of my remarks is the intensifying controversy over the conditions that influence our well-being here in the United States — particularly the threat of another unfortunate experience with protectionism.

I am well aware that I cannot go deeply into this subject in a short space. This I know because I was privileged to serve on the President's Commission on International Trade and Investment Policy. For over a year I studied every way in which this and other areas are affected by international trade and investment policies.

## Protectionist Attitude

- Let there be no doubt where I stand on the principal issue. I believe that the threat of the protectionist attitude in America is far more than an issue involving business and jobs. I sincerely believe that this stance embraces many powerful forces that will have an important bearing on whether or not all the peoples of the world make the most of their opportunities in the years to come.

I recognize that there are strong and honest differences of opinion on the proper direction of our nation's foreign trade policies. There are many persons and suppliers who have been adversely affected by foreign competition. It would be unrealistic not to acknowledge this fact of life.

## Complexity

These differences of opinion, and these dislocations of people's lives, point up the complexities of the problem. Who among us can honestly say he understands all of the ramifications involved in the balance of trade? Where is there an unchallenged expert on monetary policy? What type of restraints, if any, could or should be made on the world-wide transfer of technology? What is the proper level of East-West trade relations, and are the national defense implications of yesterday still appropriate?

> Based on a talk before the Board of Governors of the Electronic Industries Association, Phoenix, Ariz., January, 1973.

## Action

Because this is so, it will not do for anyone with a qualified viewpoint backed by experience, to be simply an observer. I am convinced that this present controversy can be resolved peacefully, but it will require action.

What kind of action will be most effective? The kind of action which is in the public interest? — not special pleadings based on the experience of a single company, or a single industry, or even a single community.

It is, of course, important to gather this supporting information and be aware of all the facts that bear on our needs, our experience and the options that governments can take to effect them. But going beyond this, we must be prepared to discuss with everyone who will exert influence on our elected lawmakers the more important question — what do all these statistics and contentions mean to me?

## The Concerns of U.S. Citizens

The concerns of the great body of United States citizens are how to assure and enhance their jobs and living conditions and be involved in what was once unashamedly described as "the pursuit of happiness".

# Let's look at just one major concern: about 1.3 million new American families are formed every year. Approximately eight million people change their jobs every year. About 3.1 million people join the labor force and 2.1 million leave it. By 1980 full employment in the United States will require jobs for 100 million people, 18 million more than were employed at the end of 1972. These, quite clearly, are the priority considerations in the minds of millions who do not clearly understand how the enterprise system meets their needs.

If they end the representatives of large numbers of voters do not understand, how can we expect their support?

I would like to review the arguments for their support in as familiar terms as I can muster.

## The Days of U.S. Preeminence are Gone

First, let's examine one portion of the real economic world we inhabit.

Of primary importance is the fact that the days of almost total U.S. preeminence since the close of World War II are gone.

We must learn to live and work in a world where foreknowledge will be dependent on other portions of the globe for some of our basic needs and some portions will be dependent on us. The U.S. is not self-sufficient in materials; nor does it have a variety of the world’s technology, the world’s innovative ability, the world's marketing savvy, the world's production know-how. What we have is to live in it harmoniously with our neighbors, many of whom are every bit as good as we are at almost everything we do.

## The Energy Crisis

I hesitate, somewhat, to use the energy crisis as an example of this phenomenon, because I recognize that there are those who question whether the crisis really exists, or who maintain that new technology will solve the problem before it reaches crisis stage. I can say at this point that the crisis is an energy shortage; it is not a crisis; for example, the fuel oil embargo for our Minneapolis operations has been cut by 25 percent for January and February, and natural gas supplies have been blocked for some companies, our schools, our common carriers.

Let's look at the dependency which is developing in this industry. In the past, the repatriated earnings of oil companies have exceeded the value of imported oil and were a favorable factor in our international balance of payments. By 1985, however, our needs for oil and natural gas could create for us a trade deficit approaching twenty billion dollars a year.

As no doubt you know, we currently import 10 to 15 percent of both crude oil and copper, 30 percent of our iron ore, and more than 80 percent of our bakelite needs. We must import all or most of our tin, natural rubber, nickel and chrome.

## Trade with the World

We cannot go it alone. We must trade with the world—and to trade, you give something to get something, with the hope that both traders get what they want and need. Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to fully realize this goal, and much of the controversy over this nation’s foreign trade policies revolves around the need to achieve it.

There is a strong and vocal body of opinion which believes that protectionist measures will achieve what is best for American workers and companies in the area of world trade. One of their principal targets are companies like Honeywell—multinational companies with substantial investments, employees and sales outside the United States.

## "Exporting Jobs?"

It is claimed that U.S. multinational corporations are "exporting jobs" overseas; that U.S. companies invest overseas to take advantage of lower wages: that imports from the overseas subsidiaries of U.S. companies cause unemployment here at home; that if U.S. companies were prevented from investing and manufacturing these companies would be forced to expand their operations in the United States, creating new jobs here: that multinational companies invest abroad in order to avoid paying taxes: that American corporations are exporting U.S. technology and therefore are helping non-U.S. companies compete in our own and other countries.

The Burke-Hartke bill has been proposed as the solution to these problems; and protectionist sentiment also underlies other proposals which may emerge for the consideration of Congress.

At this point, there may be those who will accuse of making a tactical blunder by even mentioning the allegation of our critics. But I'll go one step further. If someone would prove to me that these allegations are factual, I'd be one of the majority of supporters who would inhibit the growth of multinational companies.

## The Opposite is True: Making Jobs

Thanks to various companies, government agencies and trade associations which have accumulated the facts and published them, I know otherwise.

I am convinced, thanks to these studies, and my experience with Honeywell, that multinational companies do not export jobs, but create jobs in the United States faster than other companies. I can only conclude that U.S. companies invest abroad to gain participation in markets in other countries, not to take advantage of lower wages or so-called tax loopholes. I am convinced by these studies that imports from the overseas subsidiaries of U.S. companies have not been a major factor in U.S. unemployment.

To be more specific, I’d like to give you some information taken from a survey conducted by the Emergency Committee on American Trade, of which I am a member. This committee researched the domestic and international operations of 74 U.S. corporations representing a broad group of large multinational corporations. This survey reveals that in the years between 1960 and 1970, when these companies were increasing their overseas operations, they also provided 900,000 new jobs in the United States. They also increased their sales from American facilities - work performed in this country - from $58 billion to $113 billion - nearly doubled; in fact, their exports from the United States nearly tripled in this period, rising from $4.3 billion to $12.2 billion. In the all-important balance of payments category, they increased their net surplus of exports over imports from $3.2 billion to $6.6 billion - more than doubled.

# International Investment Activities of Multinational Companies

These figures, and other results of the survey, lead to one major conclusion: That the international investment activities of these representative multinational companies played an important role in their rapid export growth and consequently made a major positive contribution to their domestic — and employment growth.

## Double Taxation

I have tried to speak in familiar language; so I have some misgivings about discussing the issue of taxes. But the tax issue is an important one, and I’d like to cover some specific areas which are coming more and more into public discussion.

The issue is the section of U.S. tax law which allows American corporations a tax credit for the income taxes they pay to foreign countries on income earned in such countries. The purpose of this tax credit is to avoid taxing the foreign earnings of U.S. corporations twice — once in a foreign country and again when the earnings are remitted to the United States.

Opponents of this tax credit argue that since domestic firms are not allowed a federal tax credit for the state taxes they pay, the current method of taxing income from foreign sources is inconsistent with the way domestic income is taxed.

## Taxation by U.S. States

A major fallacy in this argument is that it is based on the incorrect assumption that the taxation of domestic income by city, state and the federal government is analogous to the United States taxing the foreign earnings of American subsidiaries which have already been taxed by the host country.

The proper analogy is between the way states treat corporate income earned in two or more states and the way the U.S. government treats income earned in two or more countries. Every state which has a state income tax provides a method of allocating the income of a multi-state company among the various states in order to avoid duplicate taxation of the same income. As a matter of fact, the constitution requires this. Thus the current methods of taxing foreign and domestic income are consistent.

Furthermore, where one domestic corporation in the United States has an ownership position in another domestic corporation, the federal income tax law quite properly prevents duplication of corporate income taxes. The parent company is taxed on earnings of the owned company only when such earnings are distributed as a dividend — and then at no more than a nominal rate. What logic can there be in the Burke-Hartke proposal that earnings of an overseas subsidiary — in most cases earnings already taxed in the foreign country at rates comparable to or higher than U.S. rates — should be immediately re-taxed at full U.S. income tax rates?

# International Competition by American Industry

Another fundamental element of the issue is the tax credit’s relationship to the ability of American industry to compete internationally. According to a recent survey by the National Association of Manufacturers, if the United States were to repeal the tax credit for foreign taxes paid and tax all foreign subsidiary income before it is paid out in dividends to the parent company, U.S. firms with foreign operations would be forced to pay an average effective tax on their foreign earnings of over 70 percent.

Given this added tax handicap, few American firms could continue to compete with foreign-controlled companies for world markets.

You can appreciate how useful it is to have these facts for presentation rather contradictory allegations are being made. Let’s keep the record straight!

Also useful to the undertaking on which we must all embark is the factual story of what imports and exports do, beneficially to create jobs.

## Imports Produce One Million U.S. Jobs

Labor Department figures document the finding that one million jobs in the United States are dependent on imports — jobs for food processors, ship and dock workers, truck drivers and railroad warehouse employees and retail clerks. And it’s equally impressive to consider that every billion dollars worth of exports creates 60-80,000 jobs in the United States.

As we assess the situation, let us not forget the dilemma our government faced in August 1971. As Mr. Peter Peterson wrote, the New Economic Policy announced that month was not, and I quote, “a one-shot reaction to a one-time crisis. It marked the beginning of a new era of more flexible, enduring, and viable economic relationships for the years to come. The years behind us were and large an era of success; but an era based upon a system which had become outgrown, and increasingly crisis-prone.”

## Tariffs and Free Trade

Mr. Peterson was referring to the tremendous impact that international trade and monetary factors were having on our people. We have since come to learn the difficulty of achieving universally approved economic action. And we must reckon with this reality: U.S. negotiators are preparing to enter economic talks next fall that could shape future international relationships for years to come. Our government can and should strive in these talks to put an end to present attitudes and trends that point ominously to another “Balkanization” of world trade.

It can and should seek agreement to reduce, and in the end, all tariffs on industrial trade by the end of this century.

It can and should try to create far freer trade conditions for farm products.

It can and should seek the harmonization among nations of the present hodgepodge of non-tariff trade barriers and preferences.

But these objectives will remain forlorn hopes unless our negotiators can go into these hard bargaining sessions with the clear backing of the American people and their Congress. We must give them that.

# Computer Art: The Search Beyond Manipulation

Grace C. Hertlein  
California State University–Chico  
Chico, Calif. 95926  

*"Computer arts are still in the highly experimental stage of emergence."*

In present computer art, the naive onlooker could readily misconstrue that mathematical processing of data and manipulation of design represent the total modus operandi of this new form, rather than just the initial phases of exploration. A review of the varied computer arts reveals diverse input of patterns and subsequent manipulation or transformation, creating a series of new, perceptual audio-visual images. There appears a similarity of approach to some variation of the techniques utilized by practitioners of the cybernetic arts: graphics, sculpture, film, dance, music, textile design, weaving, poetry, and architecture.

> There is a tendency to forget that the computer arts are still in the highly experimental stages of emergence, and although some attractive and very pleasing works have been accomplished, this new medium has generally not progressed beyond its mathematical and scientific origins. At times, I endeavor in hearing the outpour of computers, and one would hedge the resultant art from the category of transcending visual patterns to experimental/initial exercises, or mathematical and scientific visualization, rather than works of art per se. This latter statement is emblematic of contemporary manual experimental art. 

1. At the present time, a tendency for the computer arts to relate to an elite coterie, made up of scientists and intellectuals, rather than the public at large. However, as this new art medium is given greater space in the mass media, this audience should enlarge greatly, as exposure acquaints the general audience with the potential of this new art form.

This article is reprinted by permission from the *Proceedings of the Invitational International Exhibit of Computer Arts*, T-5, Zagreb, Yugoslavia, June-July 1973. Grace C. Hertlein is Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at California State University–Chico, Chico, Calif. 95926. Her computer art has been published for many years in *Computers And Automation* and currently some of her computer art is being exhibited at an art exhibition in Bordeaux, France.

## Pattern Manipulation

Manipulation of design by the computer may be deliberate, (or at times highly experimental) as change or transformation of the original pattern is achieved via a host of techniques developed within the past twenty years. However, in attempting to precede an understanding of design, one observes ample evidence of a growing inquiry by artists and critics in combining (manually) mechanics and art. Since the turn of the century, such techniques and philosophy have been practiced and even more verbally expressed by electronic and electronic musicians. Further, the concept of pattern manipulation is as old as man's art, and one finds ample evidence of this concept throughout art history. A few such examples are: Offset XY patterns in Persian sculptural reliefs; repetitious designs of a pattern in the compositions of Bach; Greek vases; inversions and mathematical progressions of design in the Foundation Course of studies of the Bauhaus School; juxtaposition of several works throughout music history; and randomization of musical variations via throwing of dice, as practiced by Mozart. The morality of the arts ready possibility and methodology for further exploration in such transformation of pattern, yet it was not until the speed of the computer afforded this electronic manipulation, that it became feasible to such a degree. (Alteration, change, and transformation of pattern is revealed in other technological systems that may or may not use the computer as an aid in creation: synthesized video, sound, and the film.) In other words, science and technology now afford further exploration of ideas and techniques that have been practiced by experimental artists for years.

The philosophy and practice of twentieth-century music shows a very great similarity between the manipulative techniques used by musicians since the early 1900's and the present-day computer procedures. Examination of the philosophy of the Bauhaus and study of the works emanating from this revolutionary school, also reveals great similarities in the approaches to creation, and in the final works of art of this school and present-day computer arts.

# Design State Variation

This is a term devised by the writer, adapted from given "state" variations used in printmaking, in which one may revise a plate or stone, and alter it by additions and/or changes of pattern, resulting in a series of new works. The term denotes known variations of pattern that are possible, which may be used as sub-routines or stored in the component library and readily called by the user, who defines the values of the given parameters of the specific algorithms being utilized. One of the most provocative concepts occurring in computer art is that of being to internally predict inmanipulable design state variations, in which a basic component will be visually or auditorially pleasing. The art may use only those design states that reflect personal expression of the designer. (One might compare design state variations to the many kinds of shells the sculptor may use in execution of a work of art, each yielding unique effects.) Further, this library of manipulatively design state variations is constantly being enlarged by experimenters in the computer arts. 

A brief listing follows:

- Offsets of pattern on the X, Y, X/Y (progressions in music)
- Mirror images or reversals on the X, Y, X/Y
- Scalar variations or duration of pattern in superposition of form
- Rotation, in open or closed forms
- Secondary radiation of images and forms with ground scalar values
- Redundant serial imagery in closed form
- Polygon serial imagery, with circular, square, or varied final form
- Positive and negative variations of repeated or design-related patterns
- Disintegrating variants of images and sounds in redundant or transform pattern
- Metamorphic variations of images or sounds in predetermined sequences
- Transformations of pattern, in which one design becomes another
- Alterations of design by mathematical algorithms
- Pseudo-randomizations of patterns with artist-supplied parameters
- Overlays of images and sounds in dimensional forms
- Combinations of related patterns, using any of the above design states
- Multi-media combinations, using any of the aforementioned

Prior to design state variation, the artistic idea is stated in coherent, sequenced steps. It may be flow-charted before transformation into a computer program. Thus the art idea is transformed into analyzed data, using synthetic machine languages, and is then subject to processing and manipulation via the computer using design state variations, revealing innovative new, final works. Examples include:

- The warp and weft patterns in weaving
- Classical ballets positions, with designations of the head, arms, and feet
- Structural modules in sculpture and architecture
- Derivations of design from art or musical history, including the archaic, the classical, or the contemporary
- Formulae and transformations from science or mathematics
- Stylistic analysis of a given artist's style, with definition and statement of a specified set of definitions describing the style
- Artistic composition of a given musical era, with parameters of such rules

The art idea is initially expressed in the manner of science, but it does not end there. The choice of the art idea or problem should express the personal philosophy of the originator, whether it is mathematical formulae, natural derivations from the environment, or analyses of prior styles of artists. The personal focus of the original idea, ensuring variation and execution cannot be too strongly stressed! The design state variations allow the artist to choose the given direction of psychic expression. Further, selection of specific computer systems and art materials affords a highly individual element with aesthetic concerns. Lastly, the varying techniques of execution, which may be preparatory or participatory, add a unique and personal opportunity to spontaneously participate in the formation of the work of art, or to maximize the capacities of the computer in artistic execution, using preplanned or heuristic modes.

## Diverse Philosophies of Computer Art

Stylistic analysis and resultant design derivation are highly significant in the computer arts and processes decided beneficial: these techniques allow one to analyze more thoroughly the subject under study. In addition, this allows one to analyze and reinterpret variations and permutations of the original source not obtainable by normal methods. (The writer and the authors have chosen to use more aesthetic than the original input source.) There is, however, a great tendency among humanists to concern themselves with past styles and subject matter, as being more "pure" aesthetically than the present. On the other hand, there is an equal tendency among scientists to exploit mathematical manipulation, disregard art totally, and to have the computer and its peripheral devices accomplish the work of art, without intervention by man. Here one finds two extremes, with beginning dogmatic statements by artists of varying capacities and philosophies. The insightful computer artist, however, seeks to unite personal philosophy and expression with the highest level of computer usage in a statement of artistic unity. However, one is conscious of new visions emerging throughout history, which are subsequently categorized and "cast in bronze," as "the way." Computer art appears to be no exception to this great

# Computers in Science Fiction - II

**Marcia Ascher**  
Professor of Mathematics  
Ithaca College  
Ithaca, N.Y. 14850

*"In science fiction writing, non-specialists attempt to involve other non-specialists in the human questions arising from computer use."*

In "The Computer and the Poet," Norman Cousins emphasizes that the role of poets, "those who have respect for and speak to the human spirit," becomes even more important as computer usage increases (32). Science fiction writers should indeed be included as poets in our technological age. All too often in our society, problems arising from technology are left to technologists because they are too sure of their own knowledge to question or criticize. The science fiction writings directly involving computers are one of the few places where non-specialists attempt to involve other non-specialists in the human questions arising from computer use.

## Emphasis on Man

Perhaps the most recurrent science fiction theme is the difference between computers and man. These raise the question of the proper role for humans or emphasize the aspects that make man unique. In one story (Asimov, "Robots") children are forever reading and writing purely for the joy of it; in another (Weir, "What Happened to the Teaching Machine?") where all learning is machine, only uneducated children still know how to use computers. A super-computer is defeated by a human because he can bluff or "lose to win" and it cannot (Caiden, *The God Machine*); another super-computer is robbed of its control because of a group of humans whose main desire is freedom (Pohl, *Starburst*); and to others (Dick, "The Variable Man"; Sheckley, *Fool's Mate*) human unpredictability continues to be a problem. This distinctive aspect of man is very directly stated by the computer builder in a French science fiction story (Boulle, *The Perfect Robot*). In trying to make the computer more like man, he progressively adds to its ability to deal with data, the ability to play chess, language, concepts of love, the ability to engender new machines, concepts of good and evil, and finally what he considers to be the crucial missing element - "I have unhinged them". Mike, a super-computer capable of running an entire revolution (Heinlein, *The Moon is a Harsh Mistress*), cannot understand why a joke is funny, and the computer AM (Ellison, "I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream") hates people because unlike them "he could not wonder, he could not wonder, he could not belong, he could merely be".

Science fiction writers persist in confronting their readers with a question that receives little attention: the disjunction between current concepts as expressed by the historian Bruce Mazlish (33). Just as constituencies were established with the material universe, the animal kingdom, and our subconscious, we are faced with transcending the 4th disjunction of harmonizing our existence and those of mankind in technology society. Or, as expressed by Weizenbaum ("On the Impact of the Computer on Society") the insights of science such as those provided earlier by the work of Galileo, Darwin, and Freud, and now provoked by the advent of the computer, shake man's self-esteem because, when viewed superficially, they seem to diminish man.

## Mechanistic View of Man

We diminish man and our anxiety grows more disdainful of ourselves and admirable towards machines. If computer usage is predicated on a mechanistic view of man and this mechanistic view becomes our self-image. Too many statements made by systems analysts or computer scientists display that a computer-usable view of man is being substituted for the whole man. Keep in mind the above list of human attributes contrasted to computers by science-fiction writers as you read the following statement from the widely read and much discussed book *Limits of Growth* written by well-motivated systems analysts:

> Some considered the model too 'technocratic' observing that it did not include ethical social factors, such as the effects of adoption of different value systems. The chairman of the Moscow meeting summed up this point when he said, "Man is no mere biocybernetic device". This criticism is readily admitted. The present model considers man only in his material system because valid social elements simply

# Superstates and Syservices

A concern for the use of computers in politics and government is seen in numerous stories. Opinion polling in a political campaign is involved in the 480 (Burdick), and the writing of a campaign literature in The Novocomp (Escrapist). The prediction of elections is carried to an extreme in "Franchise" (Asimov) where only one vote is needed to determine the election, and Counterfeit World (Galouye) describes an entire synthetic society (an "electromathematical model") made up for purposes of opinion surveying. Of greater concern, however, are the super-states dependent on or replaced by supercomputer systems. Many of these stories describe the process by which men gradually give up determination in exchange for material well-being, and in the belief that a larger something was needed to protect them from each other (Mandel's "The Hall"; Cole, the Funco File; Dick, Vulcan's Hammer; Fahlman, L. The Machine; Matrix; Fohl, Starchild). Often, no one really understands any longer how the systems work (Cameron, Cyberna; Cole, the Funco File; Delany, The Fall of the Towers; Dick, Vulcan's Hammer; Fahlman, L. The Machine; Jason, Matrix). In most cases, the vast destructive power of the system is realized when, for some reason, it is no longer serving human ends. One computer overemphasizes the goal of protecting itself (Dick, Vulcan's Hammer; one gets carried away by its goal of ending thermo-nuclear war (Cardy, The Gold Machine); two become lonely and hence need (Fahlman, L. The Machine; Fohl, Starchild), another becomes psychotic because of what it learns from its mind's delay, (Delany, The Fall of the Towers), others are under the control of selfish people (Cameron, Cybernetic, & Stadel, The Reproductive System). Most of the systems are destroyed by man's more flexible intellect. However, in one story (Miller, "Dumb Water"), the systems get destroyed even after there are no more people, and in another (Dick, "Autofac"), without the knowledge of the people.

## Loss of Control

Some ten years ago when discussing views of computers in science fiction, I pointed out that computers could be viewed simply as man's tools in order to discover ways in which machines get to becoming scientists. I noted that some stories focused on extensions of specific currents and emphasized man's responsibility, whereas there are some stories in which computers turn on their makers (Dniprov, "Siema"). The stories just cited have two significantly different characteristics. The stories do not begin with the construction of a machine motivated by curiosity or scientific naïveté, but instead, they begin with the populace agreeing to control by the machine. We read, for example, that in 1993 after a large world war, all nations agree to "subordinate themselves in a realistic manner ... to a common supranational authority ..." which is a machine so that it won't put "interest over reason, emotion over logic" (Dick, Vulcan's Hammer p. 19); or that another machine is built to control the world because with stone axes men could be free as they could do only limited damage before they were stopped but with advanced technology men could do damage so much more quickly they cannot be free to start (Fohl, Starchild). In A Tale of the Big Computer (Johansson), a history of life until the "computer age," we learn that man 

> could not be devised and introduced in this first effort. Yet, despite the model's material orientation, the conclusions of the study point to the need for fundamental changes in the values of society. 

> (p. 191)

> Admission that the model has a minor flaw of omitting "critical social factors" followed so blithely by conclusions about fundamental value changes surely conveys to the reader that the factors that have been dealt with are the more essential and more significant.

> Again recall the human attributes as you read:

By the same token since the thinking human being is also an information processor, it should be possible to study its processes and their organizational independence from those of the biological mechanism — the "hardware" that might implement them. (Simon and Newell, "Information-Processing in Computers and Man", p. 256)

## That’s the Theorists

> "They are mechanistic — that they postulate only the processes capable of being affected by mechanism — is guaranteed by simulating the behavior predicted by ordinary digital computers." (ibid. p. 258)

To reemphasize the contribution of science fiction, let us trace through one well-written and popular book, Stand on Zanzibar (Brunner). In the 21st century over-populated world, there is a very advanced computer Shalmaneser owned by General Technics, a company no longer to be contemplating the subdivision, modernization, and management of a small underdeveloped country, Benidni. Benidni is unique and not alone in its predatory freedom and human abhorrence. Computer analysis is the only rationalization of the feasibility of the G.T. project and for alternative plans of carrying it out. With regard to the possibility of computer analysis of what makes Benidni attractive, one sensitive character in the book says "... when they get love down to a bunch of factors you can analyze with a computer, there'll be nothing left of whatever makes it worth being human." Shalmaneser eventually rejects the data on Benidni because it is inconsistent with reality. Mulligan, the cynical biologist, gets the computer to process the data by adding the additional assumption that an unknown force is acting on the population. Mulligan points out that those who have been working toward consciousness for the better part of twenty-four years should not be dissuaded because the destruction of the data was a display of its old characteristic — "orneryness" or "bloody-mindedness", when faced with something different. It chose to reject instead of broadening its view of the possible. Mulligan sets out to find what makes Benidni different and traces it to a genetic mutation which produces a body odour that suppresses in others the territorial-aggression reaction. Mulligan's hope is that a world-renowned biologist who is working on modification of human genetic maps can use this to better mankind. His hope is shattered when he learns that this biologist has been murdered for political reasons. The decision is that the machine will work on finding an external synthetic spray. Mulligan is left away crying for lost humanity — what in God's name is it to be human, if we have to be saved from ourselves by a machine? The now conscious machine has the last word and the last sentence of the book "Christ, what an imagination I’ve got". The irony of the book is that Mulligan, who represents and speaks for those

# Evolution and Computers

is a part of the evolution leading up to computers
and that the basic cause of his failure was the in-
ability to organize a complex society. In the very
enjoyable Funco Fele (Cole), when the question is
raised, “Has it become your ruler, you god?”,
the response is, “Well, no. Not exactly. It’s more
like where our technology triumphs have finally put
us to. I guess you might say our real ruler was al-
ways an idea of what’s normal or not. Conformity, I
guess you’d call it… I suppose the Machine –
plus the F.D.I. – working together -- have sort of
externalized it once and for all.” In the stories
where there is a struggle between man and the com-
puter, it is not a struggle to retain control but to
give it back once it has knowingly been given away or
unwillingly allowed to slip away.

## Consequences of Bigness

The persistent theme in these stories is that of
systems – big systems and computer systems – and
its consequences. This bigness is eloquently described
in an article by Weizenbaum. This article is impo-
rtant in that it gives the exposure to state-
ments of this serious theme.

These often gigantic systems are put to-
gether by teams of programmers, often working
at any one time span of many years. By the time
the systems come into use, most of the origi-
nal programmers have left or turned their at-
tention to other pursuits. It is precisely
detrimental

## Computers Are Not Gadgets

The reader may argue the degree to which these
side effects are already present in our society, but,
if he reads science-fiction, he cannot ignore them.
While the first theme of the differences of man and
machines may be the most repeated, this second theme
is probably the most important. The science-fiction
writers maintain their importance as voices of the
"computer revolution" by redirecting our attention
from the computer as "gadget" to the computer as an
integral part of the modern configuration of govern-
ment-academic-industry-management which shares skills,
resources, techniques, personnel, and goals. Just as
our image of the scientist has changed from the man
standing lonely vigil over a bubbling retort to
prove his scorned hypothesis, the isolated computer,
with its programmed aura, asked the wrong question or
sensed the wrong data, is no longer hero, Frankenstein
or Savior; rather, they are very limited creations
which facilitate operators, circumscribed instruments,
and restrictive effects. Now the new computer has
remote access, varied input and output devices, can
access large amounts of data supplied by different
agencies, works in real-time, makes policy decisions
based on quasi-mathematics, commands vast resources,
and affects large numbers of people.

# EDITORIAL
*(an updated version of an editorial first printed May 1973)*

## Burying Facts and Rewriting History - II

One of the efforts of this magazine is to pursue truth. One of the ways in which truth is pursued is not to let statements of the utmost importance be buried and forgotten in the pages of daily newspapers, nor unreported and lost because they are no longer well covered in national news magazines.

Among those statements are two of permanent interest in connection with the Watergate Caper (this phrase is establishmentese for "the Watergate Crime").
- The statement by Bernard L. Barker, one of the convicted operatives, which explains his motivation and background (see November 1972, *Computers and Automation*).
- The statement by Alfred Baldwin, 3rd, ex-FBI agent, an employee of the Republican Committee to Re-elect the President, telling what he did and saw while five men burglarized the Watergate offices of the Democratic National Committee on June 17, 1972, about 2:30 a.m. (see December 1972, C44).

In addition, we have published seven installments of reports on the Watergate Crime by our contributing editor, Richard E. Sprague (a computer professional of 25 years standing) who has served as an advisor has founded for many years dirty political operations in the United States, including the assassinations by conspiracies (not "lone assassins") of President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert Kennedy, and Reverend Martin Luther King.

Three years ago in May 1970, we began to publish this type of article; we could not have begun the study of "the assassination by conspiracies" of two Kennedys and one King. But the articles we have published — which are listed and characterized on the following pages — have together a remarkable impact.

Taken together, the information published May 1970 to October 1973 in *Computers and Automation* effectively destroys a large segment of the beliefs, the rewritten history, that the establishment in the United States has arranged for people in the United States to believe. I do not assert that the establishment is a conscious organism or organization; perhaps the best description is this: a loose confederation of overt conspiracies, silent conspiracies, and biased wealthy persons, with very intelligent orchestration stemming from the Pentagon, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Presidency, and with assists from organized crime and the Mafia.

We challenge any fair-minded person to read this col-

> human failing. Even the most broad-minded practitioner is bound by his or her capacities and philosophy, and it requires a deliberate and concerted effort to remain open-minded, and to appreciate varied approaches that are not in accord with one’s own temporary aesthetic parameters. One discerns computer artists who prefer natural or man-made patterns and sounds, vs. those who desire only mathematics, electronic and computer sounds, as the human touch. There are those who exploit two or three-dimensional static images, vs. creators who prefer moving permutations in flux, deeming that the computer is a perceptual medium, and therefore should not be imprisoned in static form, i.e., cybernetic art is "pure idea," ad infinitum. Ironically, even the newest of the arts appears to be hardening within specific schools of thought, with separatist camps warring in "vs." expression and debate.

> It is obvious that the concept of manipulation and processing via the computer is merely the first stage of cybernetic creation. Even now, far beyond the statements of the artistic problem and aesthetic, personal variation, is a vast, open territory that is being explored by questioning, hardly intellectual pioneers, as they seek to perceive the inner anatomy of art and philosophy.

> When man uses the computer as an aid in creation, or when he attempts to create heuristic art, his mind finds new questions to explore and to answer. It appears highly possible that a renewed perception of life and the arts awaits present and future generations of man, and that this may be partially accomplished by eliminating the boundaries of compartmentalized disciplines, and by walking freely between art and science, by combining interdisciplinary practices and materials, to hopefully bring forth the ideal of an open, growing, and dimensional perception of art/life for the human race.

## CORRECTION
In the July 1973 issue of *Computers and Automation*, a single article entitled "Communication on Three-Way: Chimpanzee, Man, Computer." was published. Part I was authored by Larry B. Dendy of the Public Relations office of the University of Georgia and Part 2 was authored by Ernst von Glasersfeld et al. of the University of Georgia and the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center of Emory University.

In compliance with the authors' wishes, the two parts of that article have been reprinted as two separate articles. The first article is authored solely by Larry B. Dendy and is titled, "Communication -- Three Way: Chimpanzee, Man, Computer." The second article is authored by Ernst von Glasersfeld and colleagues from the Yerkes Primate Center and Georgia State University and is titled, "A Computer Mediated Communication with a Chimpanzee." Also, and in compliance with the article author's wishes, all figures and tables of the article as published in the July 1973 issue have been included in the second of these articles.

In the 1973 annual index *Computers and Automation* will enter the two articles in this manner, which serves to separate a regular article from a formal scientific and technical report.

# Virtue, in Spite of Erroneous Conceptions

J. P. Frankel  
Dean of the Faculty  
Harvey Mudd College  
Claremont, Calif. 91711  

> "We think of knowledge as knowing how-to-do-it, wisdom as knowing whether-to-do-it, and virtue (if the answer is yes) as doing it."

In this article, I mean virtue in a much narrower sense than the theologians, and I mean erroneous conceptions in a much broader sense than planners of parenthood.

Let me first speak of virtue.

## The World is Full of Problems

Now the world is full of problems where we need to know how to do it, whether to do it, and (if the answer is yes) to do it. Each of us can make his own list of pressing social problems: pollution, arms limitation, or population growth. Fortunately we are reasonably well supplied with scientists, humanists, and technologists. To understand why we still have these urgent problems, let us turn to erroneous conceptions.

The erroneous conceptions I wish to deal with here are:

- That it is within the power of scientists and engineers to choose to work only on projects "in the public interest," and  
- That the market place is where one discovers the public interest.

## Choice of Projects to Work on

Critics seem to assume that scientists and engineers are free to choose their projects, and complain that they fail to consider the real public interest. Scientists may be free to choose their work, but they have no more to say about how their discoveries are used than Christopher Columbus did.

As for the engineers, they have more to say about the uses of science, since they are the ones who choose which of science's ideas will be applied, but they then have almost no way, at present, of identifying which products or processes should be produced to serve it.

### A Moratorium on Science?

We will return to this matter of choice, but first let’s eliminate from the list of reasonable alternatives facing society, the silly and dangerous notion of a moratorium on science.

The key notion in the moratorium idea is that if you can’t control it, you shouldn’t do it. Therefore, we are urged, don’t do any more science until (presumably) the humanists can devise suitable controls. The trouble with this kind of conceptual catastrophe is two-fold. In the first place, as Paul Saltman has pointed out eloquently, you can’t control writing poetry. Science can be slowed down, of course, by driving it underground, but even if we slowed it way down, there is no evidence that we have either knowledge or wisdom enough to control its application, unless we change some of our habits.

## Ignorance and Fear Lead to Irrationality

One habit that needs correction has to do with the thinking and feeling processes of the humanists—the philosophers, if you will—who presumably are to show us how to behave. Too often they are ignorant or fearful of science and engineering. What one is ignorant or fearful of, he cannot deal with in a rational way. There is no possibility that we can learn to control what we do by some non-rational process, such as starti, using mystically-falsified playing cards, etc. Control over what we do will

# The Choices of Engineers

Most engineers do not make cosmic choices. They do not decide that this product will be built and that one won't be. Practically all engineers, I suspect, work for other engineers, who work for others, who work in companies where the products are determined not by science or philosophy, but by market analysis. Market analysis has come a long way since the days of the Edsel, and it often guesses understandably, although not always, so that the public is not necessarily buying, but what the public buys is not necessarily what it needs. 

## The Market-Place Guessing Game

We buy those things that are offered for sale that are better (in some vague way) than the alternatives available to us. Except for advertising or other ways of influencing public opinion, the basic mechanism of the market-place is a guessing game. Try this product, see if it sells. If it does, figure out what it was about that sold, and push a little harder. If this one does not sell, reinvent it a little, or gamble on another change and so on. Advertising and public opinion do play important roles in how we select so many different labels on the can of bar soap, the same automobile-buyer, but the decision as to how the engineers' skills will be used has, in the past, largely determined by the instantaneous outcome of the market game.

## Major Civil Problems

Now please do not misunderstand me. The marketplace mechanisms are important for determining soap or automobile styles. I believe that criteria of our risk-and-return of investment are elements of our decision-making processes that we could discard only at great peril to our society. What I am saying is that these civil problems: pollution, poverty, and population density, for example, are not likely to be defined by market analysis.

These problems, for which acceptable solutions need to be needed, share these characteristics:

  1. They cross product classification lines.
  2. They involve more than one sector of the economy.
  3. They are not just problems of the auto-industry, or the mining companies, or manufacturing-but-not-service-industries — they involve all of these.
  4. All the skills that all these sectors employ may have to be applied to these problems. The cement plants in the country and the transport companies in the city have pollution problems that differ only in detail. To expect them to do the necessary research and development separately, each with his eye on his own segment of the market, is to postpone until much too late, if not forever, solving even the smaller parts of our problems. The problems, so to speak, are too big.

### These Problems are Hardly Separable

In the same way, the major civil problems are not readily separable. One can reduce the amount of air pollution caused by internal combustion engines by using electric autos, for example. If so, we may replace polluted air in the cities with polluted streams out in the country where the new massive power plants are. Or we can replace solar energy with fashionable materials or fossil fuels we now use for power; however, at least in the near future, we would then have either much less energy or much more costly energy, and fewer jobs and more poverty. (Some among us tend to paint even blacker pictures. They point out that our society may give up slavery only when our technology developed to the point where machines were cheaper than slaves. Is it possible that we could deliberately reverse this process and end up with clean air, but with slaves?)

This characteristic of tight linking, and the inability of the big problems, also suggests that we can remedy our marketplace mechanisms to determine how we employ our technology to solve our problems.

## Very Difficult Problems

The third characteristic of our problems, [context: appears to be a technical term] forces us to reconsider the mechanisms of choice, is that our problems are so very difficult. The technical solutions do not exist outside of social considerations. The social costs outweigh such usual factors costs as materials, labor, and capital. Our cities present much tougher problems than putting a man on the moon. As someone once said, "We couldn't have put a man on the moon if the moon had been inhabited".

## World-wide and Nation-wide Problems

All these characteristics, and others that I've left out, such as geographical diversity — or rather problems are not local, nor even regional or national — but world-wide — suggest that the organizations needed for these new problem-solving tasks differ considerably from those of even our biggest, most diversified companies, or else that we need some super-industrial team of coordinators, who are to be responsible not to the elements of the market-place, but rather to the public interest. Whether some who has brought this problem further through most will, my thoughts, tempered by a certain pragmatism on the work of thousands of our national governments, suggest that the approach most likely to succeed in the near future is the national one.

## The National Science Policy and Priorities Act

The essentials of a first step in a national plan are contained in the National Science Policy and Priorities Act, which, among other things, sets up procedures for contracting out to universities, companies and other organizations, the research and development necessary for solution of the major civil problems, including the design of civil science systems. Whether an agency like NASA should be set up, as the Act says, or whether an existing agency should supervise new programs, is a matter of debate. The importance to our discussion is that some federal funding agency, not the various product market-places, should establish the priorities and fund the solutions to our civil problems.

# NUMBLES

Neil Macdonald  
Assistant Editor  
Computers and Automation  

A “number” is an arithmetical problem in which: digits have been replaced by capital letters; and there are two messages, one which can be read right away and a second one in the digit cipher. The problem is to solve for the digits.

Each capital letter in the arithmetical problem stands for just one digit 0 to 9. A digit may be represented by more than one letter. The second message, which is expressed in numerical digits, is to be translated (using the same key) into letters so that it may be read; but the spelling uses puns or is otherwise irregular, to discourage cryptanalytic methods of deciphering.

We invite our readers to send us solutions, together with human programs or computer programs which will produce the solutions.

## NUMBLE 7311

## Solution to Numble 7310
In Numble 7310 in the October issue, the digits 0 through 9 are represented by letters as follows:

# Nixon and the Mafia — Conclusion

*"Organized crime will put a man in the White House someday, and he won’t even know it until they hand him the bill."*  
— Ralph Salerno

---

Part 1 of "Nixon and the Mafia" was published in the September issue of "Computers and Automation". Part 2, in the October issue. Part 3 begins here with further information about the relation of President-to-be Richard M. Nixon with shady transactions in the Bahamas.

## Shakedown in the Bahamas

By the middle Sixties there was a storm brewing. Internal friction had forced out few people like Lou Chesler, while a wave of public investigations were bubbling over the role of underworld figures like Meyer Lansky. The 1967 Royal Commission of Inquiry also dredged up another familiar name — Richard Nixon.

Testimony before the Royal Commission by Max Courteney, a Lansky lieutenant, detailed a long bookkeeping career and brought out the names of a larger clientele, including the then Vice-President Richard Nixon.

### Mary Carter Paint

The Royal Commission also aired a deal which implicated Richard Nixon far more deeply than passing mention by an underground bookie.

In 1967 Lyndon Pindling became the first black premier ever to serve the almost one hundred percent black citizenry of the island. Pindling was hardly a revolutionary; however, for among the people instrumental in putting him in office was a gambler close to Lansky named Mike McLaney. The Royal Commission branded McLaney a "thoroughly dangerous person" and accused him of maneuvering Pindling into at least one deal involving a questionable gambling concession.

Part of the post-election controversy was a company based in Tampa which bore the innocuous name of *Mary Carter Paint Company*.

In 1965 Lansky's front-man (and former Key Biscayne landowner) Wallace Groves, filed a joint application with the Mary Carter Company to open a casino on Paradise Island in the Bahamas. The ubiquitous Sir Stafford Sands handled the legalities. Knowledgeable observers looked for the mystery man, and a Justice Department memo, dated January 18, 1966, predicted that "the atmosphere seems ripe for a Lansky skim".

After Pindling's election, Groves was forced out and the Mary Carter Paint Company had itself two new casinos. At the 1967 opening of one of them — the Nassau Bay Club — the honored guest was Richard Nixon.

The following year — 1968 — the other Mary Carter Club, the Paradise Island Casino, opened for discussion. The owners felt once again to Nixon for other use of their facilities during the 1968 Republican Convention. Nixon felt more comfortable at Key Biscayne, but some of his staff took up the offer.

### Mary Carter Becomes Resorts International

In 1969 Mary Carter — now called Resorts International — reluctantly "released" one Dino Cellini, claiming that while he had a relatively unsavory background, he had no criminal record, no criminal associates. Cellini hopped across the resort to Miami, where, according to David Corris' Intelligence reports, he continued to work in conjunction with Resorts International. The reports allege that Cellini was an almost daily visitor to Resorts International's Miami office, where he checked credits and worked with a company booking junkets to the Paradise Island Casino.

There are those who maintain that Cellini's connections with Resorts International symbolize the influence of Lansky. In a 1971 editorial, the *Las Vegas Sun* concluded an eleven part series on organized crime — some of which centered on Resorts International — by charging that "however cloaked and cleverly concealed by the guardians, gambling in the Bahamas is controlled by Meyer Lansky and it has been established in police intelligence reports that the fee is fifteen percent of the gross income". The now defunct *Toronto Telegram* reported in 1970 that "observers believe that the resourceful Lansky is still managing to get his cut from the Bahamas".

Resorts International, through its ninety-one percent owned subsidiary, Intertel, has denied all allegations of involvement with organized crime.

# was' Intellet that ITT hired in 1972 to snoop on col-
umnist Jack Anderson.

The latest and possibly most damaging charge in the Resorts International battle came in June 1972 in an IRS inspired indictment of Meyer Lansky and Dino Cellini. The indictment was important:

On or about May 17, 1968, indicted co-conspirator Vincent Teresi met with defendants Meyer Lansky and Dino Cellini in Miami and had a discussion wherein defendants Lansky and Cellini gave Teresi permission to conduct gambling junkets to the Paradise Island Casino.

>This government agent alleges that in 1968 Lansky maintained at least some control in running junkets to Resorts International’s Paradise Island Casino. The junket itself is a integral part of the casino operation, and as recently as 1971 Lansky’s accomplice Eddie Cellini was reportedly still arranging junkets for the Paradise Island Casino.

## Enter Nixon and Rebozo

It was in 1967 — with Lansky still okay-ing junkets and Cellini still running the Paradise Island Casino — that Richard Nixon and Bebe Rebozo became friends with the head of Resorts International.

It should be no surprise that James Golden, the recently (1969) hired "deputy director of security for Resorts International" is a good friend of Nixon's. As a Secret Service guard for Nixon when he was Vice President, Golden made a good enough impression to be appointed staff security chief for Nixon’s convention headquarters in Miami that year. Golden was also a security director for his subsequent inauguration. Later he moved to Resorts International. Golden is just one of a long string of interesting Nixon security appointees, among them Watergate indictees James McCord, Gordon Liddy, and Howard Hunt.

There are rumors, some of which have been aired in the press, that Richard Nixon owns stock in Resorts International. Former Republican Presidential candidate Thomas E. Dewey does own stock in the company, and, according to organized crime investigator Hank Messick among others, there are reports of Lansky buying stock as well. Nobody has proven anything one way or another about the stock connections, but that Nixon is connected to Resorts International, at least through Golden, is indisputable.

Perhaps more dispiriting than reports of Nixon searching solely in an underworld holding company for Bahamian casinos are the reports of his meddling in Bahamian affairs. In 1969 a proposed tax increase on gambling profits to provide money for Bahamian schools was sliced in half by the Minister of Finance. The Minister refused to explain the cut, and told opposition members to "use your imagination" for an explanation.

>The advice was taken literally by some Bahamian papers who speculated that pressure came from "outside sources connected with casinos". One Bahamian paper asked openly if "a telephone call from the White House was not responsible?".

Whereas our investigation into Cuban politics brought evidence to light possible violations of the Neutrality Act, we now have the possibility of an American President who has spent a significant amount of his vacation time in the Bahamas also meddling in the affairs of that country.

---

Richard Nixon, a man with both visible and invisible links to the underworld and politics of Presto Cub, turns up in the Bahamas with very similar links, bringing some big names along with him.

## Enter William Rogers

The two men with histories both in Bahamian politics and in the finances of organized crime have made frequent use of the legal services of a firm whose most prominent partner is Richard Nixon’s old friend William P. Rogers, one-time Secretary of State.

The two men are Mike McLaney, charged by the Royal Commission in 1967, and a business cohort of his named William Colusardo. McLaney and Colusardo were investigated in 1967 by the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with a blueberry plantation that McLaney sold to a company controlled by Colusardo. The subsequent corporate juggling implicated (among others) newly elected Bahamian Premier Lynden Pindling. Nixon counselor's "favors" for Pindling were the use of his airplane during the election campaign, and a $125,000 contribution in the form of an “interest payment”. The law firm that defended McLaney and Colusardo against the SEC was that of William P. Rogers. Rogers had been a close friend and political associate of Nixon's for twenty-five years. He accompanied Nixon on many of his Bahamian jaunts and also made frequent stops with him at the Key Biscayne Inn and Villas. In addition, being asked to "counsel" against his own friends in the Checkers affair and Eisenhower's serious heart attack.

Rogers served the Ershidner/Nixon line for eight years in the Department of Justice, first as Deputy Attorney General, and then, by 1957, as Attorney General. The Justice Department’s record against organized crime in the years following the Kefauver Commission was laughable, to say the least. It was Rogers who personally rejected the recommendations of the specially constituted Wessel Committee on organized crime set up in the wake of the infamous Appalachian raid in upstate New York that revealed a Mafia summit conference. The Committee’s proposals for a concentrated and coordinated war on organized crime were only implemented some years later by Attorney General Robert Kennedy.

A footnote in the Justice Department files views as a report by IRS Special Agent Delifnte, dated October 7, 1953. The IRS recommended the indictment against Nixon’s family in the Southern Judicial District for the intent to attempt to defraud the government of a large portion of his income taxes for the years 1945 and 1947 under section 145b of the Internal Revenue Code". The Justice Department — with William Rogers second in command at the time — respectfully declined to prosecute.

## Lums Hot Dogs

Upon leaving his post as Attorney General in 1960, Rogers became a member of the New York firm of Royal, Kogell and Wells. In 1966, with its leading partner about to become Secretary of State, Royal, etc. moved with its clients wholeheartedly into the world of gambling casinos and organized crime.

A year later Royal took on the account of the Miami-based hot dog chain, Lums Inc. What did a hot dog chain have to offer a prestigious New York law firm? The answer may lie in where the firm took its client.

# 1969 Lums purchased the Caesar's Palace Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas for $600,000. A month later the Nevada state gambling authorities were looking into the hotels’ relations with twelve under-world figures from Kansas City.

A few months after the purchase the SEC filed suit charging Lums and Caesar's Palace with "false and misleading" statements. The SEC wondered how Caesar's managed to lose $1,000,000 in five months when the previous year (before Lums bought in) there was a $2,200,000 profit for a comparable time period.

The SEC also questioned Lums concerning the $3,000,000 Lums paid one Jerome Zarowitz, a convicted professional sports fixer who wasn't even listed as an owner of the casino. Top officials in both Caesar's and Lums have been under investigation by IRS intelligence in Miami and by Nevada gaming authorities in cases involving advisors and ever since Roger's first move on the Lums account.

There is also the question of the 1971 Lums acquisition of a North Miami housing resort development called Sky Lakes. Both Sky Lakes and Caesar's Palace have received large sums of money from the Teamsters - $12,000,000 for the Miami project and more than $16,000,000 for Caesar's Palace.

With this going slowly, Lums announced plans for a new $22,000,000 casino next door to Caesar's Palace. In December of 1971 the company decided that the whole restaurant idea was no longer worth the trouble. In a classic dilemma to classic American success they changed their name to Caesar's World Inc. and hoped their stock would stand.

Meanwhile the Secretary of State's old law firm repaid a bundle with their new-found links to the Las Vegas developers. With such stunning successes at home, one wonders what a firm with a link to the Secretary of State could do abroad, in places like the Bahamas or Vietnam, for example.

> Nor do the underworld implications of big names surrounding Nixon end with the Secretary of State. Murray Chotiner, a long-time Nixon aide and architect of his early senatorial campaign, has past links to the underworld. In 1962 Drew Pearson and Jack Anderson wrote that "Chotiner ... bespeaks representing the top gangster of Philadelphia, Marco Reginelli, who represented a long and amazing list of racks, conning peddlers, and nonce tax violators and others to wielding influence in high places." It was Chotiner who brought Frank Vitale. "Once involved with the biggest bootlegging conspiracy on the West Coast," on Nixon's special mission to Moscow in 1959.

Nixon's recent appointment of Walter Annenberg as Ambassador to England also echoes the themes of underworld involvement. Annenberg and his father were indicted in 1939 for "aiding and abetting" in connection with their service operation in Chicago, an operation run with the protection of Al Capone, for which the Annenberg family was also a major contributor to Nixon's 1968 election campaign.

Further back in the Nixon saga, and closer to his southern California birthplace, lies San Diego financier, C. Arnold Smith and his bookmaker partner John Alessio. In 1946 Alessio and Smith introduced Nixon to another bookmaker named Lew Lipinsky. Lipinsky, who was convicted for bookmaking in 1938, served for three decades as a go-between for the Smith/Alessio interests to their syndicate connections.

Some of the dealings of the Smith/Alessio combine were brought to national prominence by a Green LIFE magazine article which accused Attorney General Richard Kleindienst of "Cowering with Nixon's" in a case involving Alessi, According to the Wall Street Journal, Smith raised $1,000,000 for Nixon's 1968 campaign. He and his wife took the first position since receiving line behind the President at the White House inauguration.

## More of the Same in California 

Nixon's other favorite resting place besides Key Biscayne is the area near his birthplace in southern California. Here the underworld pattern of his Florida involvement repeats itself - in a strikingly similar pattern.

One story there involves Nixon's multi-millionaire backer, C. Arnold Smith, and the El Charro Hotel in La Jolla, just south of San Diego.

The El Charro was a favorite stop for Nixon in the Fiesta Parties. Owned by a man named Al Witer, a former manager of the hotel, has alleged in statements to this reporter and others that the hotel served as a secret meeting place for politicians and assorted business interests, some of them from the underworld. Witer specifically cited a 1954 meeting attended by Nixon and chaired by a leading member of the hotel, but has offered no documented proof.

Mrs. C. Arnold Smith is a permanent resident of the El Charro, and the hotel’s visitors have included John Connally, Barry Goldwater, and Edgar Hoover. Hoover's $15,000/year bills were picked up by the stockholders of the Marchion as interest.

> The fact that certain of Hoover's good friends rubbed elbows, rather warmly, with Meyer Lansky, and the fact that the nation's leading crime fighting agency - the FBI - has come up almost blank in its fight against organized crime may not prove anything about Hoover. On the other hand, these facts don't make it any easier to dismiss questions which might arise about the influence of organized crime at the highest levels of government.

North of the El Charro and thirty miles south of the San Clemente White House, lies the mammoth Casa San Diego resort development. The development is tied to both Smith and the Teamsters.

La Costa was originally developed by Cleveland syndicate reliables Al Rosen and Nate Daltz. The development was reorganized in 1960 to bring Teamster control more in line with their investments, which already exceeded $16,000,000. Like Sky Lakes, its Florida counterpart, La Costa attracts a whole range of figures from organized crime. La Costa visitors have included Willie "Ice Pick" Alderman, a St. Louis mob cohort Morris Shenker, and Wallace Groves and mob chieftain of Bahamas fame.

According to eyewitnesses, when Groves' helicopter sets down, the red carpet is rolled out. It may be because Groves bought a home in La Costa, but more likely it's because, as government agents put it, "Where Groves appears, Meyer Lansky will not be far behind."

Another mob frequenter of the La Costa development is Jake Avery, an organizer of the Republic.

# The Teamsters Again

A recent visitor to La Costa was Frank Fitzsimmons, here to Nixon's new-found support in organized labor. Fitzsimmons is president of the Teamsters Union. This summer he stopped in La Costa on his way to see Nixon at San Clemente. Fitzsimmons had just come from dinner in Detroit with a local mafia figure and soon after his Detroit-La Costa-San Clemente excursion, Fitzsimmons announced his support for Nixon. One wonders whether the Teamster decision to stay on the Pay Board and to support Nixon is somehow related to what the Detroit Free Press has been hinting strongly as of late: that the administration has stopped prosecution of Frank's son Richard Fitzsimmons — the business partner of Detroit mobster — on charges of misusing union funds.

> Whatever deals Nixon and Fitzsimmons did make, the Teamsters have a long working relationship with organized crime. Their marriage goes back over thirty years, where Jimmy Hoffa was introduced to the Detroit underworld by Paul Dorfman, in exchange for some multi-million dollar insurance business. Dorfman’s son, Paul, has represented both Sky Lakes and La Costa and was recently convicted of taking kickbacks on a Teamster loan.

The Teamster tradition of labor racketeering and extortion made for a ready alliance with the mob. Early government investigations of the Teamsters, such as the Bobby Kennedy-led McClellan Senate Committee on Investigations, centered on labor racketeering. As recently as August 1974, Kennedy continued his pursuit of the Teamsters and their boss, Jim Hoffa. At one point Kennedy had twenty-nine grand juries simultaneously investigating Hoffa's activity — one of which led to a conviction for mail fraud and jury tampering.

In 1969, two Oakland Tribune reporters concluded a six-month investigation with the charge that the $628,000 Teamsters Central States, Southeast and Southwest Pension Fund headquartered in Chicago, has become a bankroll for some of America's most sinister underworld figure. 

> Nowhere does the relationship between this fund and the mob surface more dramatically than in Las Vegas, where Teamster trustees have approved loans between $50 and $370,000,000, have safely secured board progress and been strongly criticized by ranking Federal officials on their comments that "the Teamster fund is a sort of open bank to people well-connected in Las Vegas and well-connected to organized crime."

It was Hoffa's desire "to have [his] own bank in every city" that brought on the Teamster takeover of the Miami National Bank. The bank in turn is just one of a long list of ventures, such as Caesar’s Palace, Sky Lakes, La Costa, Worldwide Realty, International Airport Hotel Systems, Truesdale Estates, in which Teamster money amounting to over $60,000,000 figures prominently alongside the social and business partners of Richard S. Nixon — a line of investments that leads from Nixon’s three White Houses to a Federal clemency for Jimmy Hoffa and back to organized crime.

The current head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division saw enough evidence in 1967 to say that "he knew for a moral certainty [that] in the upper echelons there was an amalgamation between the Cosa Nostra and the Teamsters Union". In 1971, when a Federal Grand Jury questioned Jimmy Hoffa, many wondered if the links between the two giants were more direct than the numerous transactions between mutual friends.

A few months after his testimony, Hoffa was granted clemency after serving less than five years of his thirteen-year sentence. The freeing of Hoffa and three co-defendants of the 1963 wire fraud pension case is the latest and most crucial event in Nixon’s longstanding friendship, a friendship with some clearer public benefits for both. Jack Anderson documents, for example, that as early as 1960, then Vice-President Nixon and Attorney General Rogers intervened to halt an indictment against Hoffa in exchange for Hoffa's support in the 1960 election.

# ANICO - More of the Same in Texas

In recent years the Teamsters fund has been superseded by a giant Texas insurance company as a major source of finance for Las Vegas casinos tied to the mob. The company is the American National Insurance Company (ANICO) of Galveston, Texas. ANICO is close to the heart and pocketbook of the two ranking Texans in the Nixon administration — former Treasury Secretary John Connally and former Assistant Attorney General Will Wilson.

As well as floating more than $400,000,000 to Las Vegas casinos and $3,000,000 to partner attorney Lewis Shanker, ANICO has also made loans to Florida companies close to Richard Nixon as well — $1,750,000 in 1966 to the Mary Carter Paint Company, and $3,000,000 in 1970 to a subsidiary of Worldwide Realty.

Last year a group of disenchanted stockholders filed a multi-million-dollar suit, charging ANICO officials with having taken control of the company and using it as a private preserve as well as a source of funds for the mob.

The defendants in the suit hired Nixon's New York firm to handle the case. Connally's Houston law firm has also been used by ANICO. The Wall Street Journal of Houston, of which Connally was a director and in which one of his partners were officers, has provided $1,500.00 interest-free loans worth more than $1,000,000 for ANICO. Connally was also director of a savings association which was purchased recently by ANICO.

Will Wilson was "general" of the Justice Department's "war" on crime from 1969-1971. He was head of the Criminal Division until October 1971, when his resignation was forced by disclosures tying him to the scandal-racked financial empire of Texas wheeler-dealer Frank Sharp. Wilson has been charged by dissent ANICO stockholders of helping to drag ANICO into the twilight zones of finance with such deals as the 1963 absorption of a defaulted $450,000 mortgage held by Sharp. Sharp's attorney and "financial advisor" on the deal was Will Wilson.

While Attorney General of Texas, Wilson sued the foundation which controlled ANICO to bring three new trustees onto the foundation’s board of directors. Wilson has no visible ties to the new trustees, whose votes were instrumental in shaping the company’s new financial course. But dissident stockholders have charged that the "negotiations" that

## Whose Shift?

brought on the shift of control in the foundations were handled by a Galveston firm linked to the mob. The stakeholders also claim that John Connally played a role in these negotiations, albeit a "backstage" role. The ANICO case is part of a long history of Wilson’s involvement with the Galveston underworld.

When he came to the Justice Department in Washington, Wilson discovered the organized crime division looking into the affairs of ANICO. Since then there have been no indictments in the case and there are reports that Wilson had the ANICO files locked safely in his personal office. One source of those reports is Stewart Hogan, a former Justice Department investigator.

> Some serious conflict-of-interest charges concerning ANICO remain:
>
> - The officers of ANICO who are later represented by Nixon's law firm made a loan to a company whose top officers are long-time friends of Nixon.
> - The criminal division of the Justice Department has been headed by a man with dubious links to a company the division is supposedly investigating.
> - The company also has clear ties to Nixon's former Treasury Secretary, a man mentioned for the Vice-Presidency, the national chairman of Democrats For Nixon, and a key figure in the President's re-election scheme.

## Additional Information

### The ANICO White House

The ANICO case tasks us to a fitting endpoint to the story of Richard Nixon’s involvement with the underworld — the Department of Justice. It is an old story that criminal and political chicanery eventually become involved in the same business, but in Richard Nixon that old sin has become more of a reality than perhaps ever before in American history. For Rich and Nixon is a man whose name has been synonymous with "law and order" in America for three decades.

Yet the four-year "war" on organized crime by the Nixon administration bears more resemblance to the "peace" in Vietnam than a sincere effort to get at the mob.

In a recent interview in U.S. News and World Report (September 11, 1972), Attorney General Richard Kleindienst labeled "about 100 incidents of our underworld figures brought by the Nixon administration in the past three and half years. The Justice Department claims that many of these incidents are simply two mobsters.

### Criticism of Government’s Prosecution

Those outside the Nixon administration, however, have charged that the government’s prosecution has been both partisan and selective, aimed exclusively at mobsters linked to big-city Democrats such as in Newark, and at the "little fish" who are always in abundance and make little difference in conducting mob business. Time has reported that quotas have been established (i.e., one hundred hoodlums a month for New York City) and that arrests are "being delayed so that future quotas can be filled." The New York Times has editorialized about the ease with which petty gamblers can have been rounded up, and wondered aloud if the Justice Department isn't conducting more publicity war than one on organized crime.

Kleindienst has said:
- "If you had regarded the conversation as something regarding a bribe offer you would have immediately reported it, would you not?"

"Yes sir," replied Kleindienst, "I would have."

Kleindienst admitted he reported the bribe a full week later, upon learning from J. Edgar Hoover that Federal agents were investigating the case.

One would expect the Attorney General of the United States to be more alert. But what is more troubling are reports aired in the Washington Post.

shortly, after the indictments in the stock fraud case, a grand jury had taken months to file "Klien- dinst's" testimony on the U.S. Attorney's office in New York" and indicated that after the meeting between Kleindienst and Fong's aide, "Kleindienst immed- iately contacted Justice's Criminal Division [then headed by Will Wilson] and .... an FBI agent was as- signed to infiltrate the group of alleged conspira- tors."

Do we now believe Kleindienst's story that he "didn't realize" he had been offered a bribe, or do we believe the U.S. Attorney's office in New York? Did Will Wilson and the Justice Department hold off ex- actly while Kleindienst "made up his mind" that he had been offered a bribe, or was the decision whether or not to take it? And did Hoover and the FBI serve him?

Perhaps the answer lies in the final outcome of the actual prosecution involved. The statements in the stock-fraud case included Meyer Lansky's son-in- law, a former director of the Bank of Miami Secured- Credit, and other associates treacherously named in the testimony of Jimmy Hoffa. They were acquitted, while the messengers who offered the bribe were convicted. One wonders if that $1,000.000 did find its way into the Republican Secret treasury after all.

## The Tip of the iceberg

> "The organized criminal relies on physical terror and psychological intimidation, on economic re- lationships and political bribery, on citizen's in- difference and government acquiescence. He cor- rupts governing institutions and subverts our democratic processes."
>
> — Richard Nixon, April 24, 1969

Someone should tell President Nixon that's restoring the power of organized crime demands, above all, a President with a clean slate.

Nixon's life is like a completed jigsaw puzzle, the pieces of which have been shuffled so as to defy complete reconstruction. Some of the crucial pieces have been removed, so a full picture cannot be achieved. It is no accident that no other politi- cian has been so much written about, yet so little understood.

Indeed, much has been made of the "enigma" of Richard Nixon, his tight-lipped bearing in relation to his personal life, his unwillingness to divulge what's really on his mind.

But maybe the answer to the enigma lies in his old poker-playing instincts, in the unwilling abil- ity to keep quiet when he's sitting on cards best hidden from the table.

For there is one indisputable fact about Richard Nixon's career - his ascendancy to the pinnacle of American power has required twenty-five years of care and feeding by some very wealthy and very re- actionary men, and an extraordinarily number of them have maintained connections with the world of or- ganized crime.

During Nixon's years in office the underworld em- pire in the United States has prospered almost un- restricted by the Federal government. From its base in the gigantic resources of heroin traffic, gamb- ling, prostitution, "protection," and a host of other enterprises of violence against society, or- ganized crime has moved like a bulldozer into the world of legal, "respectable" business.

## Unsettling, Disturbing, Critical...

Computers and Automation, established 1951 and therefore the oldest magazine in the field of com- puters and data processing, believes that the pro- fessional responsibility of information engineer includes not only competence in handling information using computers and other means, but also a broad responsibility in a professional and engineering sense, for:

- The reliability and social significance of the pertinent input data;
- The social value and truth of the output results.

In the same way, a bridge engineer takes a pro- fessional responsibility for the reliability and significance of the bridge he does, and the safety and efficiency of the bridge he builds, for human beings to risk their lives on.

Accordingly, Computers and Automation publishes from time to time articles and other information related to socially useful input and output of data systems in a broad sense. To this end we seek to publish what is unsettling, disturbing, critical - but productive of thought and an improved and safer "house" for all humanity, an earth in which our children and later generations may have a fu- ture, instead of facing extinction. 

The professional information engineer needs to relate his engineering to the most important and most serious problems in the world today: war, nuclear weapons, pollution, the population explo- sion, and many more.

### NATIONAL AMERICAN BANK INSTALLS COMPUTER-BASED SECURITY SYSTEM

**Tom Burban**  
National American Bank  
200 Orandel New Orleans, La. 70130

A computer-based system designed to prevent unauthorized access to high security areas has gone into operation at National American Bank here—one of the first U.S. banks to install such a system. The IBM Controlled Access System (CAS) at National American is based on the use of magnetically encoded, wallet-sized identification cards similar to bank credit cards.

Each person authorized to enter a security area is assigned a card coded with his own security number. Employees seeking entry to a zone covered by the system simply insert their cards into card-reading devices on entrance doors, and the information is transmitted to an IBM System/7 computer for identification.

Stored in the computer's memory is a list of employee numbers and building areas these numbers are designated for. If the number of the card entitles the bearer access to that area, the computer signals the door to unlock. If the person is unauthorized to enter, the door remains closed and a security guard is notified. The elapsed time is approximately one second.

If a card is lost or stolen, a new card (with a new number) is issued and the system is alerted to deny entry to the original card. If the old card is used, the guard is alerted.

As an additional safeguard, the system can automatically log all entrance activity by individual security code, door number, date and time of day. This helps track who is where and for how long. National American can now analyze the number of times an individual enters and at what time of day or night this activity occurs. The system also has built-in failsafe mechanisms which insure security in the event of a power failure. 

"Unfortunately, we are doing business in a time when public and private institutions are increasingly vulnerable to various elements," said National American President Louis J. Rosselli III. "By adding the IBM Controlled Access System to our current security procedures, we are taking steps to ensure that our customers and employees are protected. And, by controlling access to the collateral instrument storage areas, we can make it very difficult for unauthorized people to gain access to valuable assets stored in the bank."

### NOVA COMPUTER CHECKS STRENGTH OF ROOF IN COAL MINE

**Edgar E. Gleither**

Southboro, Mass. 07772

Data General's minicomputers track hurricanes from airplanes for the U.S. Air Force; they have mounted them in helicopters; Scripps Oceanography Institute has one on a ship; a scientist bounces over Canadian glaciers which he mounted in his tracked vehicle; and an oil company uses one of the computers to control an oilfield in the Libyan desert. Now engineers at the University of Texas (Austin) have a minicomputer in the bottom of a mine.

Dr. A. L. Podio, an assistant professor in the university's Department of Petroleum Engineering, and a team of researchers from the Center for Earth Sciences and Engineering, use a Nova 8200 computer to detect possible weak spots in the roofs of mines. The computer system, developed for the U.S. Bureau of Mines, has been on the job in the flume of Kaiser Corporation's York Canyon coal mine in New Mexico. "One of the most frequent causes of mine accidents is roof collapse," Dr. Podio said. "This system was designed to use the principles of seismic explorations to identify failure planes and fracture zones in the rocks overlaying the mine roof."

## Seismic Exploration

When the area around a roof is weakening, it can be supported by beams or roof bolts.

In seismic exploration, a high energy explosion is set off, and sensitive instruments define the structure and makeup of surrounding land by recording how fast the shock waves travel through the ground. The waveforms can be interpreted to pinpoint probable deposits of oil, and to describe rock formations. "Using a large energy source like an explosion in a mine is out of the question," Dr. Podio said, "so a manually controlled impact device was designed to generate the shock waves." The impact device, which works like a BB gun, uses air pressure to shoot a round projectile at a striker plate mounted at the end of the barrel.

When the striker plate is pressed against the wall or roof of the mine and the device is triggered, shock waves are sent through the surrounding rock. The shock waves are picked up by wideband transducers and digitized by a fast transient recorder, and transmitted through the 8 VA recorder enhancement. The waveform is then displayed on an oscilloscope, which the engineer uses to analyze the data to a strike plate remote computer.

> "An incline could also modify this with the system to detect changes in rock strata as the working face of the mine advances," Dr. Podio said, "or the system could be conducted throughout the mine to directly check on the condition of rocks at predetermined key locations. Dr. Podio believes that similar systems could be used to predict the quality of rock in rapid excavation projects or could be used in nondestructive tests of large concrete structures."

### M.I.T. Music Project Uses DEC Computer

Massachusetts Institute of Technology  
Cambridge, Mass. 02139

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has begun work on a project aimed at making the Institute a major center for the study and composition of electronic music. Barry Vercoe, assistant professor of music, working with a computer given to the Department of Humanities’ music section by Digital Equipment Corp. of Maynard, is in the early stages of developing a major electronic music production facility at the Institute.

Professor Vercoe said the computer facility "will be a tool both in the hands of the teacher and the composer that will greatly aid the development of creativity. The facility also will provide an excellent tool in the teaching of musical composition for conventional instruments."

> "This is definitely not a scientific project. I’m not interested in merely getting a computer to sound exactly like a trumpet. The technological application, however, will interest some students who might approach music otherwise and some of these will be drawn into its aesthetic considerations, through which music is made." Professor Vercoe said.

#### Why compose music for a machine at all?

"I suppose someone asked that very question when man first composed music for what are now traditional instruments, instead of for the human voice alone," Professor Vercoe said. "Electronic music merely expands the forces available to the practicing composer."

The PDP-11/45 computer — coupled with music input — also will lend itself to other forms of music research, such as syntactic analysis of music structures.

Professor Vercoe is the author of the widely used Music 360 language for digital sound synthesis. He has taught at M.I.T. for two years and is director of the Experimental Music Studio. His work, “Metamorphoses for Orchestra,” was given its Boston premier early this year by the M.I.T. Symphony and was performed by the orchestra on its subsequent nation-

# COMPOSING BY COMPUTER AT ISU
## Information Service
Iowa State University of Science and Technology  
Ames, Iowa 50010  

Music composers at Iowa State University may turn from their piano keyboards and hand-written scores to a more efficient instrument for composing music: a computer. ISU faculty members are building a computerized music studio—a system that will technologically simplify composing electronic music. The studio is being designed and built by an interdisciplinary group drawn from State's music, computer science, and electrical engineering departments, under the direction of Stefan Silverston, assistant professor of computer engineering, and Gary White, associate professor of music.

Electronic music is produced by purely electronic means and the Iowa State Computerized Music System (ISMUS) will be doing just that—generating music with computer equipment. A composer will sit at the computer and write a musical composition using an electronic keyboard.

The new system, which was expected to be operable this fall, should be an easier method of modifying and editing a musical piece. The normal hand operations of changing notations on a printed score or splicing bits of recorded music are “more time-consuming and inaccurate” processes for correcting a composition, according to Gary White.

The computer composing process begins when the composer inserts introductory instructions into a teleprinter machine. On an electronic keyboard he begins to compose this piece. The computer records all musical instructions which are transferred through a digital-to-analog sound converter to the loudspeaker into sound. This immediate feedback system enables the composer to hear what he is posing simultaneously. The computer also allows the composer to automatically play back and edit what he has written simply by striking another key.

The musician has now complete one “layer” of music. If he wants to add further musical instructions to the composition, he repeats the entire process again. All layers merge together to obtain the product—a completed electronic composition.

The music instructions which the composer inserts into the system are a special electronic music notation—a "computer language.” The English words it uses can be compared to musical notation found on a conventional score—treble and bass clefs, notes, rests, and the like.

Electronic music has been used in commercial recordings, and as background music for television, radio and film. The Iowa State system will be sophisticated enough for use in serious compositional study, the production of background music for various media, and for the demonstration of sound properties.

The ISMUS presently being built is a prototype of a full-scale model. If the “test-system” proves satisfactory, “we will look for funding to build a full-scale model,” says White. The project is presently supported by a $1,170 grant from Western Electric and a National Science Foundation institutional grant of $8,698. The prototype employs a mini-computer that is owned by Iowa State.

The studio will be used as a teaching tool for the ISU music program. Composer software, the programs (sequences of operations to be performed by the computer) written for the system, will be developed so a composer can use the studio equipment without having prior knowledge of computer programming. Students will be able to learn basic acoustical concepts and principles of electronic music synthesis and to develop sensitivity to writing for the medium. Also contributing to introduce computer science courses, the system will be a novel example of computer application in a non-scientific field.

# STUDENT PROGRAMS COMPUTER
## FOR REMEDIAL INSTRUCTION
Edward D. Canty  
Digital Equipment Corp.  
Maynard, Mass. 01754

Using programs developed by a local high school district, School District 91 in Idaho Falls, has put its newly-acquired computer to work as a “super tutor” in remedial studies for disadvantaged children in the southeastern Idaho community. Designed to improve the arithmetic and language arts skills of children in grades 2 through 6, the project was introduced by director of curriculum Dr. Wallace Hanning with federal Title I aid during the district's 1973 summer session for children largely from rural farm families. According to John A. Christensen, computer services coordinator, the project proved to be successful in its initial application and it has been continued in the fall semester.

The student programmer is Robert Huntsman, 18, a June graduate of Idaho Falls' Skyline High School. Using the district's PDP-11/20 timesharing computer system installed last December by Digital Equipment Corporation, Huntsman developed programs for arithmetic and language arts to serve between 40 and 50 pupils on each of two teleprinter terminals situated in local elementary schools.

In a typical arithmetic routine, the computer types a problem and waits for the pupil's response. In the second minute of his problem a memory exercise, or several digits for reinforcement, if the answer is correct, Huntsman's program directs the terminal to ring a bell in congratulation; if incorrect, the computer supplies hint on where the mistake occurred and encourages him to try again.

Answers to English and social studies workbook questions have been entered in the computer memory, allowing students to do their homework at a terminal and receive immediate response. The computer keeps score of right and wrong answers to produce reports for teacher guidance. Spelling-recognition exercises are also in use and Huntsman has undertaken development of an arithmetic program involving fractions.

“One of the computer's major advantages is its ability to pay attention to individual children,” Christensen said. “Every child enrolled in the regular summer session was able to get experience at a terminal and benefit from these interactive programs.” He said high school laboratory assistants will continue to write instructional programs for elementary and junior high levels, expanding the library begun by Huntsman.

# RESEARCH FRONTIER

## "TALKING" BALLPOINT PEN UNDER DEVELOPMENT

**Ronald L. Deutsch**  
Stanford Research Institute  
Menlo Park, Calif. 94025

A prototype model of a simple, inexpensive "talking" ballpoint pen, under development at Stanford Research Institute (SRI), could reduce massive paperwork and delay in routine business transactions. The pen is similar to an ordinary pen in size and shape except that it is wired to a computer system. The computer is programmed to receive signals generated instantaneously as a person hand-prints characters with the pen to record information.

"Such instantaneous and remote processing of data might be invaluable to large businesses engaged in daily consumer-oriented services, such as banks, insurance companies and utilities," says staff scientist Dr. Remit D. Crane, the inventor. For example, the pen could be used by a bank teller crediting a savings or checking account. In this case, according to Dr. Crane, the data would not have to be retranscribed from a piece of paper by another employee, or the paper itself put through expensive automatic reading equipment. Thus, costs and delays could be reduced in crediting accounts or establishing such requirements.

In another case, a meter reader making his rounds for a utility could use the pen in combination with a cassette recorder. When he returned to his office, the cassette tape would be programmed into the system, thus eliminating the need for manual retranscription of a day's worth of data.

In the present laboratory version, the pen is hooked to an audio unit as well as a teleprinter, so that as a person writes, the characters appear on the teleprinter and are spoken by the audio unit.

SRI holds a patent on the pen and is currently seeking financial support for further development. Dr. Crane says he estimates that the pen itself might cost about $25 to $50. A central computer unit would be extra but could serve many pens.

# MONTHLY COMPUTER CENSUS

Neil Macdonald  
Survey Editor  
COMPUTERS AND AUTOMATION

The following is a summary made by COMPUTERS AND AUTOMATION of reports and estimates of the number of general purpose digital computers manufactured and installed, or to be manufactured and ordered. These figures are mailed to individual computer manufacturers quarterly for their information and review, and for any updates or comments they may care to provide. Please note the variation in dates and reliability of the information. A few manufacturers refuse to give out, confirm, or comment on my figures.

Part I of the Monthly Computer Census contains reports for United States manufacturers, a to h, and is published in January, July, and October. Part 2 contains reports for United States manufacturers, I to Z, and is published in February, May, August, and November. Part 3 contains reports for manufacturers outside of the United States and is published in March, June, September, and December.

> The census seeks to include all digital computers manufactured anywhere. If there are any manufacturers located anywhere to submit information that would help make these figures as accurate and complete as possible.

# Assassination Tapes

> The rulers of the state are the only ones who should have the privilege of lying, either at home or abroad; they may be allowed to lie for the good of the state.  
> —Plato: The Republic, Book Three

It’s a little frightening. The machine can listen to what you’re saying and tell, with a high degree of reliability, whether or not you are lying. It’s called the Psychological Stress Evaluator, and it is, in effect, a lie detector. Unlike the polygraph, it needs no physical connection to the subject; therefore it can be used without his knowledge. It works for recordings of his voice, so anything on tape, sound track or phonograph record is fair game for the machine. It is the first lie detector that can be used on a dead man.

Early this year, one of these instruments came into my hands. I resolved to use it to probe one of the darkest mysteries of recent history, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. I set about collecting every recording I could lay my hands on of anyone who had any direct knowledge of the affair. Soon I had compiled the tape-recorded testimony of twenty-two persons—eyewitnesses, Dallas policemen, the pathologist who conducted the autopsy, members and staff of the Warren Commission, Jim Garrison, Clay Shaw, and even Earl Warren.

I ran the tapes through the PSE systematically, taking each controversial point in turn. Did the rifle which belonged to Lee Harvey Oswald kill President Kennedy? Was Oswald the killer? Were there other involved? What of those mysterious photographs which the Warren Commission never saw—do they support the Commission’s lone-gunman, single-bullet theory? And what about the Warren Commission itself? Did its members conspire to cover up the truth?

Slowly a picture emerged. It is blurred, and it is not the picture I expected. Not all the details are there, but I guarantee this: you may believe the lone-gunman theory of the Warren Report, or you may believe the government-conspiracy theory of Mark Lane, Jim Garrison and others, but either way you are wrong.

The PSE is not a crystal ball. It was invented as an interrogation aid, a function it performs well. To my knowledge, this was the first instance of its use as a tool for historical research. To understand what I did with the PSE, one should know something about the device itself.

I first heard of the Psychological Stress Evaluator last year, when I met two of its inventors, Allan O. Bell, Jr., and Charles R. McQuiston. Bell and McQuiston, both former lieutenant colonels, retired from Army Intelligence several years ago to form a company called Dektor: Counterintelligence and Security, Inc. It was a logical second career for the two men. Both are experts in the technology of espionage. Either one could pick the lock on your front door in less time than it takes you to find your key. Colonel Bell wears a Black Belt in karate, is an accomplished swordsman and small-arms expert, and has a dozen inventions to his credit, from anti-bugging devices to a miniaturized microdot camera. Colonel McQuiston is one of the foremost polygraph experts in the U.S., a specialist in radio and audio surveillance, and a qualified locksmith.

# Document Title

The PSE grew from an effort to improve a polygraph. Standard polygraphs measure various bodily responses, like blood pressure, respiration, and perspiration. Some measure additional physiological variables. The primary variable measured is the polygraph.

Bill and Ms. Goulson discovered that the quantities composing the human voice can shift very slightly from not less than fourteen times every second. But if the speaker is under stress, this normal frequency modulation disappears, and remains the pure component of the voice. And a strong indication that the speaker is lying.

The two men developed a device to help in the treatment and planned to use it as an academic “channel” on the polygraph. This equipment is more precise and accurate as a result.

The first step was to establish a pneumatic tube as a blood-pressure curve; the PSE proved to be much more versatile than the polygraph. Because it can't work from a telephone or tape recorder. The instructor was Mike Kradz, a criminologist and retired police officer. 

The first morning of the course was devoted to the physical aspects of the PSE. The device is used in conjunction with a tape recorder, which allows for the speaker's utterance being evaluated to be recorded at a tape speed of 7 1/2 inches per second.

Then, they played back the tape and stopped at the beginning of the utterance. The recording is very small in size, long, and human readable in its design. The PSE is built into an attached case.

> As the tape recorder rolls, Kradz drills you with questions about guilt. The subject can observe the tape roll and how the PSE functions.

As the device now records less fervor, and a rumble issues back and forth across the speaker. 

On the afternoon of the first day, Kradz advised students to look for the stressed voice looks like an untrimmed hedge, with stalks of different heights sticking up (and down) in irregular intervals. But do some stress, and that hedge begins to look trimmed.

### Section 6

The more I read, the more I doubted the official account of what happened in Dallas.

![Description of an image showing a man standing next to a police car with stress lines marked; it depicts the scenario under discussion and the actions of police interrogations.](image)

Smoother the shape. If the subject was experiencing hard stress which accompanies deception, the overall outline of the figure tends to take on a rectangular shape, a concertina as seen by the player. Kradz showed slide after slide of charts during actual police interrogations.

He told us the background of each case and pointed out the tell-tale signs of deception, whenever they were present.

- That night each student took a PSE back to his room to practice operating it. Some coordination must be learned to become facile in handling the recorder and the PSE, but clearly the difficult part of the course would be learning how to read and interpret the charts.

The next day we learned the theory of interrogative responses and the security service of an East African country.

## Text Extraction
![Description of what the image shows](image)
This document appears to contain text from a narrative or report discussing the Psychological Stress Evaluator (PSE), its use in interrogations, and reflections on historical investigations into events like the assassination of John F. Kennedy. 

> **The speaker had told the truth. However, since interrogation with a PSE seemed to require such an elaborate and structured situation, I wondered if it could be used the way I had hoped, as a tool for historical research.**
> 
> **During the lunch break I took Kradz aside and asked him. Could the PSE be used outside interrogations, where the speaker was telling what may or may not have happened? Yes, he said, the PSE could be used for that. Where there was no stress, I could be confident that the speaker was telling the truth. However, when I did find stress, I had to be very careful about reaching conclusions about its cause; it could result from something other than deception. But if I hoped that Jim Garrison would prove that he had solved the mystery. He didn't. Time passed, public interest waned, and the details of the controversy dimmed in my mind, leaving only a dull residue of doubt. I had despaired of ever learning the truth. Now I know what to do with the PSE.**
>
> **It was all there: the statements made before television cameras by eyewitnesses, policemen, medical examiners, members of the Warren Commission. Somewhere in a network-television vault were the sound tracks, with the tiny, inaudible variations in voice frequency that could settle once and for all the question, “Did Oswald, acting alone, shoot and kill John F. Kennedy?” My immediate problem was getting access to the recordings. I was certain the television networks would have them, but I wasn’t sure exactly what to ask for. There must be thousands of hours of sound recordings relating to the assassination. Where, among all this talk, was the critical testimony?**
>
> **I started digging and soon discovered the existence of a group called the National Committee to Investigate Assassinations, located in Washington, D.C. I called the number listed in the telephone directory and was soon speaking to Bob Smith, the Committee’s Research Director. I told Smith that I was a writer and wanted to do a piece on the John F. Kennedy assassination. I asked him for an interview, and he agreed. We met in the offices of Bernard Fenster.**

# ssassination Tapes

#### FROM PSE

I, a successful criminal lawyer and a member of the Committee, in a modern era, am building a few blocks from the White House. Pennerwald is a small, dapper man in a thin beard. Smith is lean, intense in his smirk. Eton appeared to be their torches.

“Before we begin,” I said, “I think I should mention that I used to work for the CIA. I have four persons in the memory that CIA kills everyone.” It seems as though to suggest the angle my agency was involved in the assassinations. “I have never met anyone in the past who has had a bitter experience of a suspicious mind. It offers an indication of paranoia to accurately portray the very subject of my life.” 

Smith and I sat down, and he exchanged glances. I feel that Pennerwald clearly didn’t believe that the CIA was assassinating anyone. 

“I believed,” I said, “there were positionings. I asked if they had heard of the PSE. Both were divisive and I described it in detail. They said they agreed to work it out for the tape. They said it would be [uncertain text].

While I was waiting, I experimented with PSE. I telephoned a friend to find out if he recognized it. He claimed to have known the game, and I decided he had. I was puzzled when I asked him, “Is the number two?” and so on, and he never responded each time. I recorded his responses and then he picked, and I was [illegible: appears to be approximately 10 words/characters].

He was dumbfounded. He had not heard the PSE and thought I might be concocting some elaborate joke at his expense. When I called back and correctly identified the number he had picked, he realized it was serious. And he was shocked.

I played the same game several times with others and did not always have similar successes. With Bernard Fensterwald, I was the only to narrow the answer down to two numbers, one of which turned out to be correct.

I obtained a tape recording from CBS News of a portion of a Sixty Minutes program in which Mike Wallace interviewed Clifford Irving. The interview took place during the height of the controversy, while Irving was still claiming to have gotten Howard Hughes’ life story through a series of interviews with the billionaire. It was a consumable tape of loyal, embellished with such excruciating details as Irving’s dismemberment with his colleagues Suskind and whether Hughes kept his circling paintings in a plastic bag. 

[Page 1]

“Sir, my study of the PSE,” I had been asked concerning the inquiries in an unprecedented format of unreserved survey. It referred to the test administered in the interview beforehand, as it was the only one. I sought to find out if any procedure could also lend evidence to PSE.”

I selected a point in the interview at which Mike Wallace suggested that Irving had interviewed Howard Hughes, but had happened on them. Wallace replied, “Where did you happen on those transcripts?” Irving replied, “I got the transcripts from Howard Hughes.” I charted the statements from the PSE.

It was a period of emotional stress, horizontally blocked, with the more “trimmed-edge” view from Clifford Irving as an outright liar, and he had been caught on the polygraph, but he would have been caught if [uncertain text].

A few days after our first meeting, I received a call from Bob Smith. He had [illegible: appears to be approximately 8 words/characters]. 

The transcript was of a CBS News television program entitled The War Report, which had been broadcast in four one-hour segments on June 25, 26, 27 and 28, 1967.

I examined the transcript. The programs had been narrated by Walter Cronkite and other CBS newsmen. They reviewed every major point of controversy that had been raised by the critics of the Warren Report, interviewing eyewitnesses. Dallas policemen, medical examiners, ballistic specialists, and many others who had some inside knowledge of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. For what I had in mind, it was a gold mine. I telephoned CBS and learned that I could get a copy of the program's soundtrack if I would pay for the dubbing. I told them to go ahead.

Next I played the Lomax-Lieber tape, whereby Mark and I had been on an earlier Lomax program, and now Lieber was on to rebuff him. I didn’t read the PSE to know that Lieber was stressed. He seemed very agitated, and his brushing audibly indicated his insidious anxiety about the things Lane had said. The reactions Lomax was asking him, and his reaction to the audience. Given his highly emotional state, he did not seem a very inviting subject for the PSE. Nonetheless, I decided to give it a try.

Charting a tape with the PSE is a long and tedious process, and it was impractical to chart the entire program. I ran some of Lieber’s statements which were not disputed and discovered, as he had expected, a great deal of stress. He was pretty [illegible: appears to be 10 words/characters]. 

Most of the exchange between Lieber and Lomax, I expressed. He stated, “I have no doubt about the conclusions of the [Warren] Report.” Plenty of stress was evident, but not much more than in other statements. The second statement related to those documents which were not included in the National Archives—he asked Lieber if there was anything in the documents which would alter Lieber’s opinion. Lieber halted; it was a strange moment. Since Lieber had seen the documents and, if they would alter his opinion, they would already have done so.

It was all pretty confused and fuzzy, and I knew it reminded me of a feedback I’d already known: Wesley Lieber was very positively more enlightening than the Louis Lomax program. I hoped that the PSE would yield more enlightening results.

I finally received a call from CBS’s Washington office saying the tapes had arrived. I broke a few traffic laws getting there to pick up the tapes and returning to my apartment. I had already selected the points I wanted to check from the transcript of the program. I mounted the first tape on the recorder, ran it down to the first point of interest and turned on the PSE.

For the next three days and nights, I ran charts. When I finished, I had a splitting headache, my kitchen floor was ankle deep in chart paper, but I had a much clearer idea of what did and did not happen that day in Dallas.

Before I describe my results, I feel that I must offer the reader a few comments and observations concerning my findings.

> **Deception is not proved enough without witnesses' testimony, to arrive at the truth.**

The PSE is a well-established development of course; from then could the lying Garrison might have found some detailed linking him to the assassination and then in the line-honored tradition of procurers, through the rest of his case. But Shaw's involvement, as a result of his predicament, and Garrison's might also be the result of some suicide issue. The situation was ambiguous.

I refer to the testimony of Lee Odom, a local businessman, was attempting to explain the mysterious coincidence of the Dallas post office box number 1190 appeared in the notebooks of both Clay Shaw and Lee Harvey Oswald. In his testimony, Odom stated that he could not account for the number appearing in Oswald's notebook. He knew how it got into it as Odom's own notebook, and he had given it to Shaw when he met by chance on a business trip to New Mexico. Odom said he had shown the rest during his statement. No unrelated control estimate was available for him to run for this.

This didn’t really clear things up. There had been a number of rather unsavory allegations in the press about Clay Shaw, unrelated to the Garrison charges. Odom may have felt extremely uncomfortable about linking himself to him in any way.

By coincidence of the box numbers seemed very suspicious, but both Smith and the Committee and pointed out to me that Shaw's and Oswald's notebooks were filled with numbers, so the chance of such a coincidence was not that remote.

At this point, I began to wonder if the television camera was the "outside issue" in every case. Perhaps just being on television will so thoroughly rattle the average person that, lying or not, he is going to show stress on the PSE. I checked this out by recording and charting a number of people on television programs—public officials, men in the street, even witnesses to a particularly gruesome accident. There was occasional stress, but it never reached the high level I was finding in the assassination tapes.

I also recalled something else which put my mind to rest on this point: the PSE had been used to analyze the statements of con...

... in trial, and in civil and criminal investigations, stress levels were above normal, but not extraordinarily high. I note that I've done numerous tests in evaluating various papers regarding the credibility of the PSE and the use of testimonies. 

At this point, I began to wonder if the PSE could actually identify something on the lines of "beyond a reasonable doubt" associated with any person. This led me to further investigations on different aspects of media coverage related to high-profile assassinations...

John Oswald's rifle. The PSE showed concern about the stress in his statements.

**Patrolman Gerald L. Hill** testified that he had seen a puff of smoke on the floor near the window from which the fatal shots allegedly were fired. The PSE showed concern about the stress in his statements.

The rifle was one of the principal points led by the Warren Commission to link Oswald to the assassination. The PSE substantiated the testimony that Oswald owned the rifle and that the evidence supplied to ballistics expert indicated this rifle was murder weapon. However, the PSE did not substantiate the controversial claims of alias parties regarding the discovery of its existence. 

The hospital employee was apparently lining the truth on her rounds on the street; her stress has been a greater issue than was provided. 

The second link between Oswald and the assassination is the testimony of officer Tippit, a Dallas policeman, while riding near the scene of the first shooting. A number of eyewitnesses have testified that they saw Oswald shoot Tippit and one, them, Dorringo Beverages. 

![Description of what the image shows](image)

The witness, Charles Ehrb, was quoted by Mark Lane as having said that he had seen a portion of the President's skull flying back over the left rear end of the limousine. Lane offered this evidence of a shot from the grassy knoll. On the CBS tapes, Ehrb stated heatedly that he had been quoted out of context, and emphatically denied that any shots had come from the knoll. Despite his emotional state, there was almost no stress in his statement.

Officer Jacks of the Dallas police was riding in the limousine of Vice-President Johnson, denied that any of the shots had come from the direction of the grassy knoll. 

Three witnesses, Mrs. Caroline Walter, Arnold Rowland and Brendan, claimed to see two gunmen in the building. Mrs. Walter said she saw two men, one armed with a rifle, the scene from an overpass near the knoll. The PSE confirmed that he thought he had seen a puff of smoke on the knoll, but could not support his claim that he had heard a shot from that direction.

Within minutes after the shooting, Kenneth had been rushed to the emergency room at Parkland Hospital. There, Dr. Mal-comb Try did save his life. The physician said the President had suffered a massive head wound and a small wound in the throat. Perry performed a tracheostomy, cutting through the throat wound in an attempt to open a breathing passage. 

Afterward, when hope for the President had been abandoned, Perry met with the press and declared that the wound in the throat had been an entry wound. 

The President's body was flown to Washington, D.C. There, approximately eight hours after the shooting, an autopsy was performed at Bethesda Naval Hospital. Because of the treacherous nature of the neck wound could no longer be observed as it was at first, ovals. 

After consulting the Dallas doctors, it was noted the autopsy report stated that there were two entry wounds, one for the base of the neck and two exit wounds on the right side of the head. 

The confusion was compounded when two FBI agents present at the autopsy reported that a wound had been found in the President's back, and no corresponding exit wound had been located. Diagrams during the testimony served to confirm this, showing the lower of the two entry wounds to be below the shoulders, not at the base of the neck. What became of the bullet? The agents reported that Bethesda doctors thought the bullet had dropped from the wound when the Dallas doctors attempted each massage.

## Document from: 13-00000

**Interview with Captain Humes was informative. Just before the interview, Humes re-examined the autopsy photographs and x-rays, and he discussed them along with the CBS tapes. He said that it was important to present the location of the wounds. He had re-created a sketch which did represent these locations accurately. Their re-examination of the tapes verifies that wounds "A" shown here?**

Yes, sir, the PSE did stress: 

> "There are no wounds other than one at the exit." "No sir, there were not." Moderate as not, except to suggest exception. 

> "There is doubt that the wound back of the President's head was an entry wound?" 

> "Against pressure, stress again moderate." 

Together, how many wounds were there? 

> "There are two wounds of entrance, two of exit. At this point there seems to be."

> "I think there were the entry wounds to the right." 

> "Posteriorly, one low in the right sterior scalp, and one anteriorly on the right." 

> "Hard stress again."

> "Could be absolutely certain that what said was an entry wound was, in fact?" 

> "Yes, indeed we can." Hard stress again. The interview with Humes was one of the best and most detailed on the PSE. It was clear to me that he believed that what he was saying, but the frequent flicks of hard stress indicated that he wasn't nearly as confident of his testimony as he claimed to be. As Dr. Perry noted, sometimes it's not easy to tell any entry wound from an exit wound. 

> "Do you have any different conclusion, different ideas, any different thoughts after seeing the autopsy photographs than you had at that time?"

> No, replied Captain Humes, "we think bear up very well and very closely."

The stress was hard. 

> "Sen. Specter, one of the Warren Commission's principal investigators, also spoke on CBS tapes. He said that the case against Oswald tied together very well, and that he could see find among actual criminal convictions a case equally persuasive." 

He added that there was no foundation for the charge that the Commission had been biased. 

The PSE said he was telling the truth. 

> "Mr. McCloy, a member of the Warren Commission, said that he had seen no credible evidence to contradict the findings of the Commission. The PSE backed him up on that."

It failed to do so, when speaking of the Warren Report. 

> "There was nothing fraudulent about it." Here the PSE showed hard stress. 

If Specter and McCloy were as confident as the PSE show them to be in the truthfulness of the Warren Report, what could be said about it? Perhaps the snippits of a few loose records, the evidences of a few pieces of inconvenient episodes that combined conflicted with a version of events they believed to be essentially true.

The man who could be expected to have the most informed opinion regarding the work of the Warren Commission is Chief Justice Earl Warren himself. He had described it in detail in the CBS program in 1967, but he did appear in the interview on May 17, 1972, in an interview where he said: 

> "... we found no evidence of any kind that there was any conspiracy." 

There was very hard stress on "no evidence."

---

> This was part of a series called The Bran-dels Television Recollections. Bob Smith of the Committee provided me with the tape. 

The interview was an hour long, but the Kennedy assassination and the Warren Commission may be only one chapter. The interview, Abram Sachs, Chancellor of Bran-dels University, was friendly and deferential. I showed some of Warren's remarks unrelated to the assassination and found that he was generally unsubstantiated.

Sachs raised the subject of the Commission publicly, and Warren volunteered several rather lengthy statements about it. 

Warren said that immediately after the assassination there were two theories. One that Khrushchev and Castro were behind the killing; the other that a group of right-wing Texas oilmen were responsible. He said:

> "We explored both of those theories for ten months and found no evidence that either of them was involved in it."

The PSE showed hard stress. He continued:

> "... we found no evidence of any kind that there was any conspiracy." 

Again there was stress, and particularly hard stress on the words "no evidence."

> "I have read everything," said Justice Warren, "that has come to my notice in the press, and I read some of the documents that have criticized the Commission very heavily. But I have never found any kind that we didn't discover on our own in determining the case as we did."

Hard stress rose again. 

> "I have found nothing since that time." 

He continued to change his view, nor have I heard of anything that has changed the view of any member of the commission since that time.

The stress was hard. As I had come to expect, the word "nothing" seemed a particularly beautiful example of stress. Archer said: 

> "It could have been something, or something in particular?" 

On January 19, 1970, Senator Richard B. Russell, a member of the Warren Commission, revealed that he had reviewed the Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.

> "There was a lot of interest in the assassination tapes. Of course, these few thousand feet of recording tape are only a small fraction of the relevant testimony recorded and stored away in the archives of television news departments. There is, for example, Lee Harvey Oswald, as he was identified by Maria Oswald, Jack Ruby and others."

> "I have no doubt about with these tapes, a Psychological Stress Evaluated; came to work on them, a very detailed picture of the assassination of John F. Kennedy could be reconstructed, a picture that might even reveal the identities of the assassins and their co-conspirators. I hope that's gone or later someone does this. I have gone as far as the prime resources of a free-lance writer."

What, given the same type of testimony I have processed with the PSE, can I say about the assassination?

---

> "We should examine the testimony in which so stress was found, since it is certain that as they seem this strongly suggests the following:"

1. Oswald owned a rifle. 
2. A bullet found that rifle was found on Governor Connally's stretcher at Parkland Hospital.
3. Bullet fragments alleged to have been found in the presidential limousine also came from Oswald's rifle. 
4. At least one eyewitness believes he saw gunsmoke on the grassy knoll, but another is equally certain no shots came from that direction. 
5. Oswald shot and killed Officer Tippitt. 
6. At least one member of the Warren Commission and one member of the Commission's staff barely believe in the validity of the Warren Report. 
7. Jim Garrison had little or no case against Clay Shaw.

Almost all of this tends to support, in one way or another, the Warren Report. But how...

# Testimony Called Into Question by the PSE

1. The claim that Oswald's rifle was found in the Texas School Book Depository.
2. The claim that bullet hulls matching Oswald's rifle were found in the same place.
3. The claim that one gunman was seen in the "Oswald window" of the Dallas Book Depository.
4. The claim that two gunmen were seen from this window.
5. The claim that a gunman was seen a different window of that building.
6. Another claim that no shots came from grassy knoll, and a claim by the witness who saw the gun smoke on the knoll that he also heard a shot from that direction.
7. A claim by a Dallas policeman that neither he nor Officer Tippitt knew Oswald.
8. The claim that the pathologist—who was there when they took the X-rays—supported his findings.
9. The claim by Earl Warren that the Commission found no evidence of a conspiracy; that none of the Warren Report's  facts ever found anything the Commission missed; that he had found nothing since the publication of the Report to change his mind; and that he knew of no Commission member who had ever changed his mind about their conclusions.

> If we accept that each instance of stress indicates deception, an interesting and unexpected possibility emerges:

Oswald was involved in some way in the assassination, if only as a fall guy. Some of the Dallas police force may have been involved, planted the evidence that implicated Oswald, and covered up the fact that there was a conspiracy. The medical examiner believed his own testimony to the Warren Commission, but later had doubts. The Commission found evidence of a conspiracy but didn’t believe it, so they covered it up in order to present a tidy package to the public. Later, at least one member of the Commission changed his mind, but since he didn’t know what really did happen, he was no worse than blundering.

I could say all this with certainty if I knew what the stress analysis equates to. Unfortunately, I do not know that. But the PSE thought that if the assassination tapes had been released, this would prove much about regarding the Warren Report. This raises not only from specific points the very sinister implications of the very existence of deception among policemen, government officials and Commission members. The question remains: did such deception exist or was the stress found by the PSE the result, in every case, of an outside issue?

> Obviously, whenever stress is found by the PSE and cannot be cross-checked by structured interrogation, some probability must be accepted that this stress is produced by an outside issue. No study has yet been conducted to establish which probability must be accepted, but let's pick for the sake of discussion, a figure that may seem ridiculously high—70 percent. In other words, we are assuming that 70 percent of the PSE finds stress in testifying is results from something other than lying. 

Now, let's ignore the deception indicated in the testimony of the eyewitnesses; even if present, it might have resulted from mere desire for attention. That leaves eight "in-siders" who demonstrated stress when making statements supporting the Warren Report: the Dallas policeman Hill, Asst. Jackson and Weitzman; the medical examiner. Wesley Lieberl; former Justice Earl Warren. Assuming that there is a 70 percent chance that any single insider’s stress is "outside issue," what is the probability that all eight instances are due to factors other than deception? Elementary probability theory tells us that it is seven-tenths raised to the eighth power, or approximately 6 percent.

In other words, even making some fairly conservative assumptions, there is a 94 percent chance that at least one of these eight men is lying.

> My own personal opinion? I don't know. I remember the young man with the ring. He said he was wearing it, and he was, but he stressed. He stressed not because he was lying, but because there was something about that ring that really bothered him, something he didn’t want the world to know. Perhaps that is also true of these men who, in one way or another, learned some part of the truth about the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

I suppose I’m not absolutely sure even of that. When I first met Bob Smith of the Committee, I asked him if there was anything the government could do to clear up the mystery. Yes, he replied, the one thing that would help more than anything else would be to make available the physical evidence—the detailed FBI lab reports, the X-rays and autopsy photographs, the microscopic slides, the bloodstained clothing, yes, even the President's brain, wherever it has been hidden. These things, he said, would go far toward answering the questions about what actually happened that day in Dallas. Maybe they would even confirm the Warren Report.

So when I say I’m not absolutely certain these men are concealing something, I mean I can think of something that could conceivably change my mind. That is, if the government would open all its files on this matter to us and prove that we are wrong— we, the people who ten years later still believe we haven't yet heard the full account of the events of November 22, 1963.

# CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY  
## WASHINGTON, D.C. 20505  
### 14 MAY 1968  

TO:  
Director  
Federal Bureau of Investigation  
Attention: S. J. Papich  

FROM:  
Deputy Director for Plans  

SUBJECT: Assassination of Martin Luther King  

1. On 3 May 1968, an official Italian Intelligence Service provided this Agency's representative in Rome with the following information on one James RAY:  

   A James RAY, born in Los Angeles on 8 March 1928 (father's name Oliver), arrived at San Gimignano, Siena, in March 1955 and registered as a student at Perugia. In 1956, RAY was confined at San Gimignano Hospital and in 1957, he was in Sant’Antonio de Fiesole Hospital. These confinements were for "osteo-political condition causing bone depression in the cranium, on right parietal temple region." RAY returned permanently to the United States in December 1967.  

2. The Italian National Police and the Italian Intelligence Service have turned up no other information thus far. All Italian entry posts have RAY and his aliases on their watchlist.  

3. The Federal Bureau of Investigation representative in Rome was advised of the information in paragraphs 1 and 2 above.

# CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY  
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20505  

16 MAY 1968  

MEMORANDUM FOR:  
Director  
Federal Bureau of Investigation  
Attention: Mr. S.J. Papich  

SUBJECT: Investigation in Japan of Report on Suspicious Actions of Gerald Lee Richards, Originally Described as Resembling Suspected Assassin of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

1. Reference is made to the report concerning the above subject made by telephone to Mr. S.J. Papich at 0930 on 17 April 1968. Following is a full account of the investigation made in this case:

   A. On 16 April 1968 a United States National Maritime Union official in Yokohama reported that one Gerald Lee Richards, who bore a general physical resemblance to the description given of the suspected assassin of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. had arrived in Japan about 15 April 1968 and requested a position aboard any ship going anywhere. Richards became agitated when asked for a contact address in Japan and refused to divulge his Japanese residence. The National Maritime Union official described Richards as 5' 10" tall, 155 pounds, with brown hair, a receding hairline on both sides, and a not very prominent scar two and one-half inches long traversing the center of his forehead, his most outstanding characteristic being a disconcerting, idiotic grin resembling a constant grimace. According to Richards' documents and statements, he was born 8 April 1937, applied for seaman's papers in San Pedro, California, 16 June 1964 and registered there as a United States National Maritime Union member on 21 February 1968 but never shipped out. His Social Security Number is 562-46-5078; his United States Coast Guard Number Z 2711-782.

```markdown
B. A subsequent check with the Japanese National Police Agency confirmed the biographic data supplied by the National Maritime Union official. A ward check indicated that Richards originally resided in Japan from 1963 to 1964 and married TAKAYAMA Michiko in 1963. Both Richards and his wife left Japan for the United States in 1964. Richards returned alone to Japan about 15 April 1968. His wife's address in the United States is listed as 160 Hosoi (phonetic) Street, Carpenteria, California, 93013.

C. A photograph of Richards obtained from the Japanese police was shown to the National Maritime Union official and identified by him as the individual in subparagraph 1A above who had applied for a seaman's berth. The photograph of Richards bears no apparent resemblance to photographs of suspected assassin James Earl Ray provided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

2. The above information has been given to the Legal Attaché of the United States Embassy in Tokyo.
