possibility of ROBLEJO being involved in possible intelligence activities. 

The FBI does not actually utilize Building T90 or T94 to conduct interviews of Cuban refugees. However, CIA under the guise of U. S. Immigration and Naturalization Service interviewers interrogate these Cubans at this location. A supply of the FBI “aviso” and the Director’s message to newly arrived Cubans are distributed at this location. 

It is to be recalled previous investigation has disclosed ROBLEJO has been in contact with [REINALDO ABREU, C?] Attache at the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City and connected with Cuban Intelligence [?in?] 

[?] on June 29, 1967, HM-1115-S reported LUIS RICARDO ALONSO, former Cuban Ambassador to London, who defected in 1965, has been in correspondence with [ABREU?] having been introduced to him by RAUL ROA, Cuban Minister of Foreign Relations. In 1964, [ABREU?] reportedly was in charge of dealing with Cuban exile groups and Cuban guerrilla groups and more specifically was handling matter in contact with ROBLEJO since he, [ABREU?] handles the matter of Cuban political prisoners. HM requested [ABREU?] since he is unable to return to Miami, has requested [RODRIGUEZ AZTANGAR] to come to Mexico and converse with NICOLAS ROJAS IZQUIERDO in New York City in connection with this matter. 

WM T-1 is SERGIO OSWALDO BETANCOURT COLLAZO.

The enclosed LHM is classified SECRET to protect the identity of a potential informant of continuing value. 

In the event the Bureau deems that the enclosed LHM may be disseminated, a copy of this LHM may be furnished to the [?] inasmuch as it does not contain any information
