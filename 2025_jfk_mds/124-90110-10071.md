# CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
## WASHINGTON 25, D. C.

29 MAR 1963

**MEMORANDUM FOR:**  
Director  
Federal Bureau of Investigation  
Attention: Mr. S. J. Papich  

**SUBJECT:**  Fran[c] PECAR  

1. Reference is made to our memorandum number CSCI-3/773,057, subject as above, dated 10 October 1962.

2. Joseph MEROLA, 2018 North Bay Road, Miami Beach, Florida, has advised representatives of another office of this Agency that he learned from contacts in New York that (fn) PECAR, a Yugoslav trade official in the U. S., is being recalled to Yugoslavia and wishes to remain in the U. S. According to MEROLA, PECAR will visit Miami from 12 to 19 April 1963.

3. While MEROLA has an unsavory background, the representative who spoke with him is inclined to believe that he was telling the truth in this instance. MEROLA claimed that he has also informed the U. S. District Attorney of the above development.

4. It seems probable that (fn) PECAR is identical with the subject of referenced memorandum, who was assigned to New York in late 1962 as an INWTRTRADE representative.

5. We would appreciate receiving any information available to your Bureau concerning PECAR's alleged desire to remain in the U. S.

6. If the above information is true, this Agency may wish to consider the desirability of contacting PECAR in an effort to persuade him to return to Yugoslavia at our behest.
