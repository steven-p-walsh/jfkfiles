1.

REALLY WANT PEACE, ZENITH OF THIS CHANGE CAME WHEN UNITED STATES ANNOUNCED IT WAS WILLING TO SELL WHEAT TO SOVIET UNION. ACCORDING TO DAPCEVIC, THIS ANNOUNCEMENT MADE TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON SOVIET PEOPLE AND THEIR FEELING. IS NOW SO FAVORABLE TOWARD AMERICANS THAT EVEN IF SOVIET LEADERSHIP WANTED TO REVERSE THIS FEELING, IT COULD NOT EASILY DO SO.

1. ON 26 NOVEMBER, CZECH FIRST SECRETARY VYSLATKA STATED THAT CZECH EMBASSY IN ATHENS HAD NOT YET RECEIVED REACTION OF PRAGUE TO THE ASSASSINATION, BUT FEELING OF CZECH EMBASSY PEOPLE IN ATHENS WAS THAT U.S. POLICY WOULD NOT CHANGE MATERIALLY. VYSLATKA EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT ASSASSINATION WILL HAVE DELAYING ACTION ON IMPROVED EAST-WEST RELATIONS; UNDER KENNEDY, THINGS WERE MOVING QUICKLY TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING, AND CHANGE OF PRESIDENT NOW WILL OF NECESSITY SLOW DOWN THE COURSE OF EVENTS BECAUSE "PERSONAL FACTOR" IS NOW MISSING. KENNEDY HAD DEVELOPED CONTACTS WITH SOVIET LEADERSHIP AND ACHIEVED ACCEPTANCE OF SOVBLOC [GARBLE] POPULATIONS AS PEACE LOVING MAN; JOHNSON HAS TO ESTABLISH THIS FOR HIMSELF NOW, AND IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME.

2. ON 29 NOVEMBER, SOVIET FIRST SECRETARY VITALIY NOVIKOV STATED THAT SOVIETS DO NOT EXPECT IMMEDIATE CHANGE IN U.S. FOREIGN POLICY BECAUSE WITH ONLY ONE YEAR BEFORE ELECTIONS, JOHNSON AS NON-ELECTED PRESIDENT IS NOT LIKELY TO CHANGE BASIC KENNEDY

POLICIES. SOVIETS ARE ANXIOUS, HOWEVER, OVER FUTURE EAST-WEST RELATIONS. ASSASSINATION CLEARLY SHOWS RADICAL RIGHT-WING ELEMENTS ARE STRONG, HAVE SUPPORTERS IN LOCAL POLICE AND POLITICAL CIRCLES AND ARE WILLING TO FIGHT FOR THEIR IDEALS. IT ALSO REVEALS, NOVIKOV SAID, STRENGTH OF REACTION IN AMERICA TO KENNEDY POLICIES. SOVIET PEOPLE FEAR THAT RIGHT-WING WILL BE DOMINANT.

ON 29 NOVEMBER, ROMANIAN AMBASSADOR MIRCEA BALANESCU SAID HE WAS CERTAIN THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN BLOC POLICY VIS-A-VIS WEST AND ANY INCREASE IN TENSION WOULD BE RESULT OF CHANGED AMERICAN POLICY.

5. FIELD DISSEM. STATE ARMY NAVY AIR EUCOM CINCMIL CINCOUTH (PERSONAL).  

6. HEADQUARTERS COMMENT; MISSING PORTIONS WILL BE DISSEMINATED ONLY IF THEY MATERIALLY AFFECT THE SENSE OF THIS REPORT.
